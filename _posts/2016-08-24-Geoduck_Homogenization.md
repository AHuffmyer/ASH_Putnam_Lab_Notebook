## Sample list 20160824
EPI Tubes:   
* 276 
* 282

## Sample list 20160825
EPI Tubes: 
* 275 

Homogenized samples on liquid nitrogen and split in half for RNA and DNA extractions
Placed samples immediately on dry ice and moved them directly to -80° storage 

## RNA Extractions
* Added 1.0ml of RNAzol to each tube and homogenized with teflon pestle
* moved 0.5ml of homogenate to new tube
* Added 0.4ml of nuclease free water to each new tube
* Added 0.5ml of RNAzol to the initial homogenate-RNAzol mix and replaced at -80°C
* Proceeded with [**RNA Extraction Protocol**]({% post_url 2016-08-26-RNA-Extraction-Protocol %})
