Homogenization of juvenile geoduck samples for use in nucleic acid extractions

Used the [**Tissue Homogenization for Nucleic Acid Analysis Protocol**] ({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/_posts/Homogenization_N2_protocol.html) to grind tissue on liquid nitrogen

Homogenized samples on liquid nitrogen and split in half for RNA and DNA extractions
Placed samples immediately on dry ice and moved them directly to -80Â° storage
