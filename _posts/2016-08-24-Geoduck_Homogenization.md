## Sample list 20160824   
* EPI-276 
* EPI-282
* EPI-283
* EPI-289
* EPI-290
* EPI-298
* EPI-299
* EPI-302
* EPI-303
   
## Sample list 20160825  
* EPI-275 

Homogenized samples on liquid nitrogen and split in half for RNA and DNA extractions
Placed samples immediately on dry ice and moved them directly to -80° storage 

## RNA Extractions
* Added 1.0ml of RNAzol to each tube and homogenized with teflon pestle
* moved 0.5ml of homogenate to new tube
* Added 0.4ml of nuclease free water to each new tube
* Added 0.5ml of RNAzol to the initial homogenate-RNAzol mix and replaced at -80°C
* Proceeded with [**RNA Extraction Protocol**]({% post_url 2016-08-26-RNA-Extraction-Protocol %})

## RNA Quantification 20160826
* Diluted samples 1:100 in nucelase-free water
* Used 10µl of sample and 190µl of Qubit Mix
Ran [**RNA Quantification Protocol**]({% post_url 2016-08-26-Qubit_HS_RNA_Protocol %})
