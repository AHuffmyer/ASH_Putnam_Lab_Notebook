This posts describes extraction protocols for ITS2 and 16s sequencing for the 2020 *Montipora capitata* developmental time series.  

# Overview

Extractions were performed by E Strand and K Wong in the URI Putnam Lab.  

The protocol written by E Strand can be [found here](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-02-01-16s-Sequencing-HoloInt.md).  

Processing, extraction, dilutions for 16s [described here](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-11-09-KBay-Bleaching-Pairs-16S-Processing.md).  

Processing, extraction, dilutions for ITS2 [described here](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20211109-ITS2-KW-AH-ES-samples/) and details on methods testing [here](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20211104-ITS2-Test-set-for-KW-AH-ES-samples/).
