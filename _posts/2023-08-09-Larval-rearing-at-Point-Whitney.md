Today, we moved larvae that were spawned and reared at Pt. Whitney hatchery (~48 hrs old) into HUDL systemsfor the [Roberts Lab USDA oyster project](https://github.com/mattgeorgephd/USDA-SRGARP-gigas-carryover). 

The larvae were provided by Pt. Whitney for us to use. We first concentrated the larvae by pouring onto a 30µm seive and rinsing into a ~1L measuring jar. We estimated larval density and on a plankton counting slide. We have approx. 2.2-2.5 million larvae. 

We cleaned the HUDL systems and then allocated larvae evenly across 10 HUDLs to have approx. 220,000-250,000 larvae in each.

HUDLs all had water flow and bubbles. Water flow was delivered from a header tank at 28°C. 

We started the peristaltic pump to deliver algae to the larvae. It was set at 75 with 2 min on and 2  min off. We ran this for about an hour on the larval pool with approx. 12.5 million algal cells per mL. After one hour, fluorometer readings were between 16-20. We are aiming for about 15. We reduced the pump to 25 with 2 min on and 2 min off. After another hour or so the readings were between 12-16. 

To calculate cell density from the hatchery stock, we used the following calculations: 

1. Load a sample from the algal stock onto the hemocytometer. 
2. Count the number of cells in 3-5 of the large squares until a count of 50-100 is reached. 
3. Use the [worksheet on Google Drive here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bc8oJOv-uJZ5Fj_zUaL5Zuj60RINt8YFBW1yTNNbGUk/edit#gid=0) to calculate cell density and the amount of stock that should be used to load our algal bucket each day. After talking to staff, we are aiming for 5 x 10^10 cells total in the bucket each day.  

The equation on the Google Sheet is as follows: 

1. Number of cells counted / number of squares 
2. Number of cells per square / 4 x 10^-6
3. This gives the number of cells per mL
4. 5 x 10^10 / cells per mL = mL volume of stock required
