## Overview 

In this project, we conducted a 2-week thermal hardening of seed provided by the USDA ARS POGS program. These oysters were shipped on May 29-30, 2025 under a WDFW permit and the experiment was launched on 6/2/2025.     

Oysters were exposed to the following conditions:  

- Control: Ambient temperatures (approx. 14-16°C)
- Treated: Daily exposure to elevated 25°C temperatures for approx. 5 hours

After 2 weeks of these treatments, oysters are going to be outplanted at Manchester on the docks in SEPA cages to assess survival and growth over the summer.  

Here are the activities we performed to deploy oysters in the field for the experiment on June 16, 2025.  

## Mortality assessment and cleaning  

Before field deployment, I checked oysters for mortality and did not find any dead oysters. Oysters were assessed from 10:00-11:00.    

I then added another layer of mesh bag to the oysters so they are secure for deployment.  

Oyster bags will retain their original ID tags.

## Field deployment  

Oyster bags were kept in their tank groups and placed into SEAPA cages. For example, all oysters from Tank 1 were added to the same cage for a total of four cages (see metadata below).  

Each bag also contained the respective temperature logger for each tank group. Oysters were deployed at approx. 11:30.   

We removed barnacles from the cages and then hung the cages off of the Manchester dock.

Mac and I will return monthly to assess and clean the cages. The Manchester folks will also keep an eye on the cages and clean lines as needed.

## Temperature loggers 

I set up Hobo TidBit MX400 temperature loggers in each tank. The loggers stayed with their respective oyster cohort/tank group.    

- Logger 22105353: Tank 3 (Control) > field tag 
- Logger 22105354: Tank 1 (High) > field tag 
- Logger 22105356: Tank 4 (Control) > field tag
- Logger 22105358: Tank 2 (High) > field tag

Loggers will log temperature (°C) every 10 minutes throughout the deployment.  

| logger   | tank | treatment | header | field_tag |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 22105353 | 3    | Control   | 1      | R008      |
| 22105354 | 1    | High      | 2      | B028      |
| 22105356 | 4    | Control   | 1      | G058      |
| 22105358 | 2    | High      | 2      | R013      |

## June 11 2025 - checking temperature loggers 

I went to Manchester to download the loggers on June 11 2025 to make sure the temperature exposure was working correctly. We had a power failure in the middle fo the experiment, but this was resolved after a couple days. Exposures were back to normal for the second week of the experiment.
