This post details activities at Point Whitney from 28 June 2024.

# Overview 

Today Kathleen and I were at Point Whitney to run a round of stressors on Kathleen's triploid/diploid experiment and conduct stressors on broodstock and new seed.  

## Checking on larvae 

I checked on the larvae today and dropped all HUDLs onto a 40um screen. I looked for larvae and saw very few, we likely lost most of the larvae.

I cleaned all HUDLs and put larvae back in. I also increased water flow to all HUDLs to be equal and turned up the water to the header to meet the demand. 

Fluorometry measurments in HUDLs were 1, 2, and 2 when I came in at 11:00. This is likely because the food header was empty. I filled it and at 15:00 the levels were at 24, 32, and 30!

## Broodstock weekly stressors 

Broodstock from bags 99 and 100 were added to a bucket with fresh water from 11:43-12:13.  

## Kathleen's stressors and stressors for new seed 

Today we did stressors for Kathleen's experiment by increasing temperature in the right tank to 35°C with a few inches of water. We had some electrical overload problems, so we ultimately did this using 1 800W heater and 2 300-500W heaters. All heaters were add to the 35°C tank to get it up to temperature. Then, one heater was put back in the larval tank set to 28°C and one went into a bucket of fresh water to heat to 35°C.  

We did the following stressors: 

1. Kathleen: Diploid and triploid groups at 35°C in seawater for 4 hours (bags 60 and 65). Done from 12:12-16:00. 
2. New PW seed: Freshwater for 1 hour in a bucket. Done from 11:45-12:46.  
3. New PW seed: 35°C seawater for 1 hour in the right tank. Done from 12:33-13:33. 
4. New PW seed: 35°C freshwater for 1 hour in a heated bucket. Done from 13:07-14:07.  

There are 10 total bags of seed with ~1K seed each sourced form Point Whitney commercial hatchery. Here are the bags inventoried with their treatments. We did the temperature and fresh treatments today and will do immune treatments once we decide on methods. Steven [has a post about these seed here](https://sr320.github.io/tumbling-oysters/posts/sr320-26-ploidy/).

This updated tag inventory is on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/inventory/tags_PointWhitney_20240619.xlsx).  

I also launched a logger SN 22023399 to log temperature every 15 minutes starting on 6/28/2024 at 14:00. This was zip tied onto one of the dock bags for the new seed.  

During stressors, control oysters were left at their respective tank locations. Stressed oysters were returned to locations after stressor.
