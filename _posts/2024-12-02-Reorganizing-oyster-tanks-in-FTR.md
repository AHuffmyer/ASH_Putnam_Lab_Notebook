Today I moved all the oysters in FTR into plastic crates to organize and give the oysters more water flow.  

The crates have mesh structure for water flow but are small enough to keep the smallest seed contained.

Loggers SSN 22023409 and SSN 22023408 are deployed with one in each blue tank.  

Two baskets are in the left blue tank and two are on the right.  

I now need to clean the tanks and refresh the water tomorrow - the tanks are dirty.   

These oysters can be used for tests and preliminary experiments!
