Hatchery day at Point Whitney for the USDA & WSG projects.

# Overview 

Today we visited the Point Whitney hatchery in Brinnon, WA to check on the status of the *C. gigas* lifestage carry over experiment. 

The experiment is detailed in [Eric's notebook](https://eric-ess.github.io/notebook/). Overall, Eric conducted a project in which four lifestages (three seed/juvenile classes and adults) were exposed to a conditioning/chronic stress event where temperatures were increased to 25°C daily over a period of 6 weeks. After this, an acute stress was run where individuals were exposed to 30°C. There are controls for conditioning period and acute period held at ambient temperature with reciprocal exposure design. 

# Tasks 

Today, we cleaned tanks, assessed survival, and measured max. length of all oysters. We also talked about needs for equipment and tank construction and discussed possible experimental design for next steps. 

1. **Cleaned tanks:** We removed oysters from tanks, rinsed all oysters and containers with fresh water, and wiped and refilled large water baths.
