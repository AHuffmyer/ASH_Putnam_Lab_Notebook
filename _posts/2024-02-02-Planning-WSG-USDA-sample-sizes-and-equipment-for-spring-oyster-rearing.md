This post details experimental design thoughts and brainstorming for the WSG and USDA project efforts. 

# Chatting about experimental design 

Steven and Eric and I talked about potential experimental design ideas. Here are the main takeaway ideas: 

- We all agree that running a latent acute stress would be interesting and worth doing. Note that individuals exposed to the first acute stress were all sampled and not available for secondary exposure. This would produce the following treatment groups for each lifestage:  

*Conditioning treatment - latent acute treatment*  

Control-Control
Control-Treated
Treated-Control
Treated-Treated 

This would provide interesting information on a few things. 

- First, it would provide information on whether the conditioning exposure produces differential stress tolerance in a latent acute stress. The hypothesis is that pre-conditioning elevates stress tolerance. 
- Second, it would provide information on lifestage-specific conditioning capacity. Which lifestages can be influenced by conditioning and how does conditioning affect performance in a latent stress between stages? The hypothesis would be that earlier developmental stages would be more receptive to conditioning effects as a product of developmental plasticity that does not exist in adults. 
- Third, we could compare the results of the first acute stress to the latent acute stress. This would be interesting to determine whether conditioning provides immediate or latent effects for stress response. The hypothesis is that conditioning does not improve (and may actually reduce) immediate stress tolerance, but provides positive latent effects on stress tolerance. 

We will need to think about these hypotheses and what we would like to measure. Here are some of the ideas we discussed: 

- RNA analyses: 1) qPCR as Eric is planning to do to look at expression of target genes. These target genes may include stress tolerance, heat shock proteins, membrane integrity, energy metabolism, metabolic stress, oxidative response, and related genes. 2) 3' or TagSeq of a subsample to look at transcriptome-scale shifts in functional roles of expressed genes.
