Today Steven and I went to Point Whitney to prepare oysters and clean for over wintering.  

# List of tasks

### Heath trays 

We have the following stocks in the heath trays that will remain over the winter: 

- 8 stacks (left hand side) of PolyIC seed
- 5 stacks (right hand side) of USDA familes (2023 POGS) 

We cleaned and rinsed all of the stacks and replaced them in a new order. I downloaded and kept the temperature logger with the stacks (in the PolyIC stack).  

I also took images for size reference of all PolyIC stacks.  

### Dock bags 

We had several projects on the dock. Today, we pulled out the seed bags containing 10K seed, PolyIC seed, and leftover conditioning Efforts seed. These bags were rinsed and then transported to UW in coolers.  

We also had a few bags of broodstock. We have two bundles of bags - one with Toad and Pink families and one with USDA POGS broodstock bags (5 bags). These were left on the dock on the blue line attached to a dock cleat.  

### Transport to UW 

Tomorrow I will transport the oyster bags to UW. We will remove dead shells, size sort the oysters, clean the oysters, and add them to FTR tanks for experiments.
