This post details activities at Point Whitney from 8 August 2024.

# Overview 

Today I cleaned all bags, checked on the tanks, and took lifestage carry over project size measurements .  

## Moving 2024 USDA family heath trays

Today I moved all the heath trays to the right hand stack so they are exposed to the same conditions. The logger was already in a tray on the right hand stack. Only family 25 was in the left stack, the other tray (33) was empty.

All the seed look good and trays were pretty clean.  

## Broodstock and Effort C/extra PH families

All of our remaining outdoor bags and broodstock are in the last two 10-holers.

I took out all bags and the 10K seed bags and gave them all a good rinse with fresh water with the hose to remove dirt, sponges, etc. 

They all looked pretty good and are now clean. No obvious mortality.  

## Downloading loggers

Today I downloaded the temperature loggers that were with the LCO oysters, broodstock, heath tray, and Effort C/PH family 10-holer.  

I forgot to download the 10K seed logger.  

All data uploaded to [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main/data/environmental/loggers).  

## Lifestage carryover size measurements

I took size measurements for the LCO project today. I will upload the data to GitHub later, but kept photos of the notebook and spat images in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover/data/size/notebook_images/20240808).  

Only 3 of the adults died. Will continue to monitor size and mortality. Returned to the tanks.
