I have listed active manuscripts below and their status along with my writing goals!  

They are organized from "oldest" data sets to "newest" data sets.  

## E5 physiology 

*Status*: Final writing 

*Next step*: Full draft to coauthors  

*Timeline*: Complete writing and send to coauthors August 2025

## Hawaii2023

*Status*: Data analysis, methods complete

*Next step*: Finish RNAseq, lipids, metabolites, and phenoplate data analysis and finalize methods

*Time line*: Wrap up data analysis by September 2025

## Moorea2023

*Status*: Sample processing, draft of methods

*Next step*: Write methods complete up to this point, start RNAseq and metabolomics analysis when available  

*Timeline*: Process metabolomics by September 2025

## Resazurin paper 

*Status*: Final draft 

*Next step*: Send to coauthors by August 2025  

*Timeline*: Submit by September 2025  

## Lifestage Carryover/Hardening
