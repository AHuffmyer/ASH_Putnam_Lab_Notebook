This post details RNA extractions for the 2023 Moorea Symbiotic Exchange project, which contains both larval and recruit samples.  

# RNA Extraction Protocol 

The protocol for this work is documented in my [notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral-RNA-Extraction-Protocol-for-2023-Moorea-Project/).  

The sample metadata [is on GitHub here](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023/blob/main/data/rna/rna_samples.xlsx).  

### 20250613 

Today I transferred tissue samples for all larval samples ("A" and "P" sample IDs) from original screw cap cryovials into 1.5 mL safe-lock RNA free Eppendorf tubes. 

- Thaw samples on ice (stored in RNA/DNA shield)
- Transfer to new tube labeled with sequencing ID 
- Add new RNA/DNA shield to bring total volume to 1000 µL. Use the new RNA/DNA shield to ensure all material is gathered from the original tube. 
- Stored at -80°C. 

I'll next complete this process for the remaining recruit samples. 

### 20250708 

Today I finished transfering all samples to the 1.5 mL labeled safe-lock tubes as done on 20250613. I transferred any tissue or skeletal samples along with the liquid for each tube. 

I then froze all samples at -80°C.  

Next I processed the 10 test samples (T1-T10) through bead beating and RNA extraction. I used the protocol described [in my notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral-RNA-Extraction-Protocol-for-2023-Moorea-Project/). For these test samples, I only processed RNA and did not proceed with DNA extraction.  

The bead beating and extraction process was as described in the protocol. I ran the bead beater at the 8 setting (medium-high) for 2 minutes and then spun down all samples at 2000g for 1 min in a centrifuge. 500 µL were then transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube for RNA extraction. Extra material and beads were frozen as well for back ups.  

After extraction (took about 2.5 hrs to do 10 samples), I quantified concentration using the Qubit.  

Here are the results:

Concentrations look good! In general RNA concentration is 20-50 ng/µL and I do not see any issues with a particular species or lifestage. I will move forward with processing the samples for sequencing.  

Each day, I will thaw the samples on ice (n=10 per batch), bead beat, aliquot, extract RNA and DNA, and quantify RNA.
