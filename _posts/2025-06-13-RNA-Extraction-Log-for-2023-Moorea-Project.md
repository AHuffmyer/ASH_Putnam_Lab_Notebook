This post details RNA extractions for the 2023 Moorea Symbiotic Exchange project, which contains both larval and recruit samples.  

# RNA Extraction Protocol 

The protocol for this work is documented in my [notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral-RNA-Extraction-Protocol-for-2023-Moorea-Project/).  

The sample metadata [is on GitHub here](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023/blob/main/data/rna/rna_samples.xlsx).

Today I transferred tissue samples for all larval samples ("A" and "P" sample IDs) from original screw cap cryovials into 1.5 mL safe-lock RNA free Eppendorf tubes. 

- Thaw samples on ice (stored in RNA/DNA shield)
- Transfer to new tube labeled with sequencing ID 
- Add new RNA/DNA shield to bring total volume to 1000 µL. Use the new RNA/DNA shield to ensure all material is gathered from the original tube. 
- Stored at -80°C. 

I'll next complete this process for the remaining recruit samples.
