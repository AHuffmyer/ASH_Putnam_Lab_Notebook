This post details my personal workflow for open science and sharing data in my research projects. This document will continually be updated as I learn more tips and tricks for open science! 

# Open Science Workflow  

#### My general workflow for open science in research projects includes:   

1. Gathering and organizing data and open access notebooks
2. Data analysis and collaboration in GitHub, RStudio, open notebooks, and high performance computing centers  
3. Manuscript writing  
4. Permanent data storage in open repositories
