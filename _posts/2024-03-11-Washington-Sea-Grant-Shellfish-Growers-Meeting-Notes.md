This post contains my notes and thoughts from attending the [Washington Sea Grant Conference for Shellfish Growers](https://wsg.washington.edu/event/2024-conference-for-shellfish-growers/) on March 11-12 2024.  

# Day 1

## Welcome session 

- General welcome session
- History of aquaculture 
- State of industry 
- Story map of aquaculture at [Sea Gardens Across the Pacific](seagardens.net)


## Topic 1: Pest Management 

### Integrated Pest Management Working Group Updates: David Beugli, Willapa Grays Harbor Oyster Growers Association and Laura Butler, Washington State Department of Agriculture

- IMP working group 
- Problem: burrowing shrimp (mud and ghost shrimp) burrow, disrupt substrate, remove nutrients. All shellfish culture methods are susceptible. 
- IMP monitors presence, abundance, damage, densities, and treatment 
- Biological, cultural, mechanical, chemical, and testing methodologies 
- Work with Willapa Grays Harbor Growers Association (WGHOGA) and Department of Ecology 
- To date, no solution identified but several leads for natural oils and mechanical methods of control

### Collaborative Research to Understand Coastal Cutthroat Trout and Salmon in the Nearshore Marine Environment: James Losee, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife

- Salmon do stay in Salish Sea during marine part of their lifecycle, but we are missing data about this "alternative" life history. 
- These are referred to as resident salmon, especially chinook and coho. 
- Check out Losee's papers for more information - he has a lot of interesting fisheries work! 
- Cutthroat trout are far less studied than salmon, and he is working on this now. 
- The cutthroat life cycle is different than salmon - they stay nearshore and overlap with shellfish habitat in shallow water. Year round present with high site fidelity. 
- They may migrate elesewhere for spawning, but this is often short with return back to site.  
- Doing telemetry work to track movement. 
- They spend time around mussel rafts and eat diverse thigns - including some shellfish "pests". 
- Shellfish could be supporting cutthroat and salmon life history during stay in Salish Sea.  

### Green Crab Research Project: Laura Kraft, Washington State University

- European Green Crab can eat lots of things - including oysters, mussles, clams, and maybe geoduck (although probably just siphon snipping). 
- Ran choice/no choice experiments to determine preferred prey items for invasive adult crabs.
- Crabs ate more Pacific oyster spat than adults with no difference by crab sex or size. 
- They preferred larger spat (ate more 5 mo old spat than 2 mo old). 
- An outstanding question is what is the size/age refuge for Pacific oysters? When do the shells become too tough for a crab to crack? Because of shell strength, mussels are preferred food source. 
- Suggestion for growers is to cage spat to protect them or put them out after they are larger with harder shells. 

## Topic 2: Shellfish Mortality 

### Clam Mortality and New Technology Gaps/Needs: Andy Suhrbier, Pacific Shellfish Institute

- Green crab shellfish prey items 
- High mortality coincides with lack of recruitment in Manilla clams 
- Possibel predation of clam seed 
- Crabs can settle inside clam bags 
- Growers are concerned with lack of clam production in Willapa Bay 
- 2016 decline coincided with low recruitment 
- Potential factors contributing to this are water quality, seasonality, toxins, predators, and settlement/fecundity 
- Currently doing grower surveys including core sampling and netting 
- Running correlations to historic environmental data 
- [nvs.nanoos.org/expolorer](nvs.nanoos.org/expolorer)
- Also doing in person surveys for mortality and pests 
- Low spring survival and no significant recruitment in the last 10 years 

### Virginia Institute of Marine Science Oyster Mortality Workshop Update: Bobbi Hudson, Pacific Shellfish Institute

- VIMS workshop goals and results
- Goal is to look at summer mortality causes and impacts in the Eastern oyster, C. virginica
- Pacific folks including B Hudson and S Roberts attended
- SUMS = sudden observed mortality over a short time frame 
- Sudden, unexplained, spring/summer, unusual, syndrome mortality 
- Not exclusive to triploids, but triploids can be more susceptible 
- Stressors including low salinity (<13ppt), temperature, pH, low dissolved oxygen, food limitation, and others 
- Dr. Ralph Elston ruled out diseases as no primary disease is the cause. Some infections are opportunistic in stressed animals 
- Reproductive organ failure, poor digestion, gill damage, feeding inhibitor could all be possible causes or combinations of these 
- Also observed in the east coast
- Combination of husbandry, environment, and genetics 
- Research efforts include genetics/ploidy, hardening, tolerance, water quality, pathology, and farming practices. 
- May vary by bag type as well
- Priorities include effectiveness of hardening to withstand stress, breeding resilience, understanding risk, interactive effects, communication, and collaboration

### Rapid Response Network: Julieta Martinelli, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; Rana Brown, Squaxin Island Tribe; Ashleigh Epps, Washington Sea Grant

- Rapid Response Network through WDFW 
- Developed after June 2021 heatwave and need for rapid response to monitor mortality and state of situations 
- Standardized sampling for management and industry during heat waves or other stress events 
- Development ideas 
	- target species
	- index sites
	- control sites
	- sampling method
	- metrics like abundance and size
	- baseline to define "change"
	- data loggers
	- frequency
	- monitor and evaluate plan
	- adaptive management
	- data sharing 
- Tribes - states - industry 
- Early alert network with growers 
- Trial in spring/summer and workshop in fall 
- Developing a shellfish mortality reporting tool for public use 

## Topic 3: Enhance Farm Technology 

### Wet Storage System: Bill Dewey, Taylor Shellfish

- Wet storage system at Taylor Shellfish to reduce vibrio loads 
- Testing vibrio with kits 
- Stacked tote systems that have water treatment 
- Oyster shell filter to remove ammonium 
- Reduce incidence of illnesses 
- Biological control mechanism of storage 
- 3 days at 52°C reduced vibrio loads by >95%
- Will be up and running by August in Lynch facility 
- Scalable to small systems 
- Includes foam fractionation system to remove particulates 
- No trade off with taste or quality 
- Expensive to operate, high energy usage 

### Evaluating the Potential for Co-Location Of Marine Energy and Aquaculture in Puget Sound: Laura Nelson, Pacific Northwest National Laboratories and Liz Tobin, Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe

- Department of Energy reserach = National Labs 
- Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) is the only marine lab in DOE system of labs 
- Powering Blue Economy Initiative to improve community resilience and sea operations including aquaculture 
- Located in Sequim
- Marine energy = wave and tidal energy 
- Predictable and reliable energy sources, but marine environment is challenging 
- Jamestown S'Klallam tribe is partner for climate change plan 
- Net zero carbon goal by 2032
- Point Whitney, Manchester, and John Wayne Marina locations 
- Spatial analysis -> energy assessment -> outreach and engagement 

### Connecting Farm Outcomes with Environmental Monitoring Data: Micah Horwith and Natalie Coleman, Department of Ecology

- How can scientists connect with growers? 
- Today they solicited observations from growers at the conference 
- Department of Ecology has 25 year history of water quality sampling over 37 sites. OA sampling is newer to their data set (<5 years) 
- North Sound, Hood Canal, South Sound, Willapa Bay & Grays Harbor 
- Temperature data from 1999 to present shows increasing temperatures with strong 2015-2016 heatwave across region 
- Over last 5 years, OA conditions were "worse" in North Sound and "better" in South sound. But these measurements were taken in mid channel and may not represent intertidal. 

## Topic 4: Shellfish Economics and Policy
