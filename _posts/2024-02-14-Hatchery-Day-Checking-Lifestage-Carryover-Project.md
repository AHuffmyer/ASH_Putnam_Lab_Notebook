Hatchery day at Point Whitney for the USDA & WSG Lifestage Carryover Project. 

# Overview 

Today I visited the Point Whitney hatchery in Brinnon, WA to check on the status of the *C. gigas* lifestage carry over experiment. 

The experiment is detailed in [Eric's notebook](https://eric-ess.github.io/notebook/). 

See previous posts about this project in [my notebook](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/categoryview/#wsg-usda). 

# Tasks 

- Checked on water flow and positioned tanks such that water will flow directly into them even if the tubing comes off the outflows
- Cleaned water outflows
- Cleaned and rinsed all tanks

I noticed that the algae food bucket was empty when I arrived (~13:15). I filled it from the header tank at 14:00. 

I took a quick look at the juvenile and adult stages and did not see any mortality! 

Overall everything looked clean and happy.
