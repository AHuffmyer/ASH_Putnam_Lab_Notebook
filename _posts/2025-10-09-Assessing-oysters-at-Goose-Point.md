Today Steven and I went to Goose Point in Willapa Bay to assess outplant oysters. 

# Overview 

We assessed oyster outplants at Goose Point today. All of the information and data for this project can be [found on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main).  

Today we took images and counted dead oysters in n=14 bags, which were redeployed for the winter. 

All data is available under `outplanting` directories in the repo linked above.  

# Assessments

We have 14 bags outplanted at Goose Point identified with large yellow cattle tags.  

There was some mortality - bags ranged from 0-8 dead oysters (out of 60-90 total oysters).

All images were uploaded to GitHub. I [created an issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/2347) for data analysis and I may try automating this with AI at some point.  

# Loggers 

I downloaded n=4 loggers. Here is the temperature data we have for this summer.

# Next steps 

- Image analysis for outplants
- Assessments in the spring
