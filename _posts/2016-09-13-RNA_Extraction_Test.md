Tested RNA extractions for improving quality and identifying if peaks prior to major ribosomal peak are degradation or RNA from gut contents

## Sample list used for comparisons  
* EPI-309 S-309 = siphon tissue only stored in RNAlater, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80
* EPI-309 M-309 = whole body and some siphon tissue stored in RNAlater, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80 
* Geoduck10 G-10 (hemolymph from Grace) = adult hemolymph stored at -80, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160913, and extracted immediately
* EPI-56 = whole body stored at -80, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80
* EPI-103 = whole body tissue stored in RNAlater, ground to powder on liquid nitrogen on 20160912, and stored at -80
* Blank = extraction procedure and QC blank

## Extraction Procedure
* Used ~10mg plastic scoops to transfer 4 scoops (~40mg) of ground tissue to 0.5ml RNAzol
* Homogenized again with teflon pestles in microfuge tubes with RNAzol
* Proceeded with [**RNA Extraction Protocol**]({% post_url 2016-08-26-RNA-Extraction-Protocol %})
* After initial centrifugation, yielded ~0.65ml of supernatant that was mixed with 0.65ml of 100% ethanol and was added to the spin column step

## RNA Quantification 
* Diluted samples 1:100 in nucelase-free water
* Used 10µl of sample and 190µl of Qubit Mix
* Ran [**RNA Quantification Protocol**]({% post_url 2016-08-26-Qubit_HS_RNA_Protocol %})
* Saved samples at -80°C in 3 aliquots (3,3,~22,~22µl)
