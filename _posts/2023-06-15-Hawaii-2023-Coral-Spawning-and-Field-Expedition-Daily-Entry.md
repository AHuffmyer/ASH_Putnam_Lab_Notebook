# Project Overview  

The goal of this field expedition is to conduct research on larval thermal tolerance in *Montipora capitata* larvae hosting different symbiont genera. *M. capitata* is a vertically transmitting coral and passes symbionts to offspring through the gametes. This work is funded in part through the National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to AH and the University of Washington eScience Data Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to AH. More information on the abstract of the NSF OCE PRF award can be [found here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2205966&HistoricalAwards=false). 

Below is a visual overview of our project: 

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/master/images/NotebookImages/Hawaii2023/overview.png)  

The goal for this expedition is to answer the following question  - *How does symbiont community identity impact thermal tolerance and larval energy usage under stress?*     

We will address this question by measuring: 

- Larval photosynthesis-irradiance curves and photophysiology
- Larval thermal performance curves: respiration and photophysiology 
- Larval gene expression
- Larval lipidomics
- Larval metabolomics

## Rearing embryos

Embryos were maintained at night by CRL staff. At 07:30 Ariana came into lab and did a cleaning due to the morning mortality. The buckets of embryos from 6/17 were clean and only needed minimal care. C conicals looked good and also needed pretty minimal cleaning. The D conicals had higher mortality and are at lower density. These required a more thorough cleaning to remove the dead material. 

Water flow was raised to 15-20 mL per 5 sec at 08:00. D1 has the lowest density, D2 and D3 are better, but still lower than optimal. We will require about 15,000 larvae of D and C. We will assess the conicals today and consider alternatives to make sure we have enough sample size. 

One option is combining 6/17 and 6/18 cultures. Since we will be working with mature larvae, the one day developmental difference is not an issue. This will also add more parent colonies to the cultures. We would combine both the D and C cultures so that each symbiont type is treated equally. 

The other option is to compare our bleached parents Cladocopium cultures with Ford's non-bleached mixed symbiont cultures. These cultures have a majority D with some C. These cultures have many larvae, so this is a good option. 

We will keep all options open until the time we need to decide. 

At 12:15 Ariana and Jill drained D1 since it had very few larvae (<500) and added these larvae to D2. We then drained the D bucket and added it to the D1 conical, providing a 6/17 D culture. We did water changes in the C buckets at 12:30. 

All corals were babysat the rest of the day with mixing and cleaning if needed every hour. Cultures were stable.

Buckets are at similar temperatures. We will monitor these to make sure they dont get too warm or deviate from the conicals.

## Rearing embryos from 17 June spawning

Cultures were checked frequently and were clean and healthy at 07:30. At 08:00 the cultures had some mortality and were goopey. This has been seen before - it seems that ~08:00 is the time when unfertilized eggs degrade and cause declines in culture quality. 

Ariana cleaned the cultures by removing the debris, wiping the surface with kimwipes, and bumping the embryos off the banjo filters. 

Flow was increased to 15-20 mL per 5 sec at 08:00 to flush out cloudy water. 

C3 had the most mortality and Ariana did an 80% water change. The conical was refilled after about 30 min. 

Flow for all conicals was reduced back to 7-10 mL per 5 sec at 09:00.

The D cultures had lower density and lower quality than the C cultures. 

Cultures were cleaned every 1-2 hours.

## Jill's developmental time series sampling 

We sampled for Jill's developmental time series project at 9am, 2pm, 8pm, and again at 3am. See Jill's notebook for details. 

## Spawning prep 

Corals were set up as described in the previous night with nets put on the colonies at 18:45. 

Our options for tonight, if material are available, are: 

- Consolidate yesterdays larvae into n=1 conical per symbiont type and fill n=2 conicals per symbiont type tonight 
- Keep yesterdays larvae in buckets and fill n=3 conicals per symbiont type tonight
- Dump yesterdays conicals and fill n=3 conicals per symbiont type tonight 

We will make this decision once we see how spawning goes tonight. 

## Coral spawning! 

The corals went bonkers tonight! We had a large and successful spawn. When we began to see many corals spawning we decided to move all of yesterday's larvae into 5 gallon buckets and clean and reset the conicals for new gametes. 

The conicals were drained at 2100 through a seive into 5 gallon buckets. There was 1 bucket for the D conicals pooled together and 2 buckets for the C conicals pooled together. These were covered with a lid and left outside for the night. They will stay outside in shaded areas. 

We had many parents spawn and contribute to the gamete pool tonight.

Gametes collected from these colonies were all pooled together at 21:30 and allocated into falcon tubes (3-5 mL per tube). Tubes were gently rocked from 21:30-22:30 until bundles had broken up. Sperm water was removed at 22:30-22:45 and the remaining eggs and sperm water were added to conicals without water flow. Embryos were then allowed to sit in conicals for about 20-30 minutes. This gives an additional rinse to the eggs and a final chance for bundles to break and fertilization to occur. 

4 mL of gametes were added to C conicals (more material available) and 2.5 mL added to D conicals. 

Between 23:00 and 23:30, 90% of water was drained from the conical to remove any sperm. The banjo filter was then put on the conical and the water turned on at ~7-9 mL per 5 sec and allowed to fill slowly. 

After this point, embryos are gently stirred, debris removed, and bubble bumped every ~1 h throughout the night by CRL members and Ariana.

## Checking Jill's developmental time series test samples 

At 3:00am Jill checked the wildtype developmental time series samples. She observed that the ambient embryos were developing and looked healthy. The high temperature samples were more opaque and had more mortality. This is likely because they were on the top shelf of the incubator. We will check the temperature loggers to see what the temperatures were on that shelf. We may adjust the temperatures down a degree if needed for tonight. 

At 8:00am we looked at the embryos again and did a practice sample protocol. The protocol we tested was pouring all larvae into a cell strainer from one falcon tube and then taking out all larvae in a known volume of water. This volume of larvae will then be split in half - one sample for molecular and one for physiology. If this protocol works, we will drastically reduce the number of falcon tubes we need which will help maintain air flow in the incubators and reduce loading time. 

Full details are in Jill's notebook. 

## Calibrating temperature and pH probes 

Ariana calibrated the pH probe and set up probes for daily measurements. 

Digital thermometer: Traceable 4000 NS 200390599  

- no calibration needed   

Apogee light sensor: Apogee Model MQ-510 SN 3706  

- no calibration needed  

Thermoscientific Orion Star: A221 pH meter SN K12290  

- Calibrated pH with tris. Note that this probe does NOT measure conductivity. We will need to use a refractometer for salinity measurements. 

Salinity refractometer: DD Aquarium Solutions H2Ocean precision equipment  

- This refractometer is the CRL's and we will use it to check salinity daily. Records in ppt units.

## Spawning and embryo rearing 

We netted the adult colonies at 18:45 as described for previous nights. 3 C colonies and 3 D colonies spawned with sufficient amount to use in pooled fertilization. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/master/images/NotebookImages/Hawaii2023/tube_bundles.jpeg) 

This picture shows how the gametes are captured in floating falcon tubes with stop valves. When there are 2-5 mL of gametes, the tubes are removed and capped and brought into the lab for pooling. Some parents produced more than others and their relative contribution to the pool is recorded below. Note that tonight the C dominated coral pool included two bleached phenotypes and one non-bleached phenotype.

Ideally, we would have n=5 or more parents contribute to the pool in relatively equal proportions and we would not have a mix of bleaching phenotypes in the same symbiont phenotype. Tonight these were the only parents that produced enough for pooled fertilization. We will rear these embryos through tomorrow. If tomorrow's spawn is better we can replace them and if not we still have material for our experiment! 

| Date     | Parent ID | Bleaching | Symbiont | Volume in Pool | Time Pooled |

| 20230617 |      1213 | B         | C        |            20% |       21:15 |
| 20230617 |       742 | NB        | D        |            33% |       21:15 |
| 20230617 |        70 | NB        | D        |            33% |       21:15 |
| 20230617 |       684 | NB        | D        |            33% |       21:15 |

The gametes from parents were pooled at 21:15 after collection from spawning and distrubuted into falcon tubes with 5 mL of gametes of either C or D symbiont pools. These were then gently rocked by hand until 22:30-22:45 when all bundles were broken and sperm and egg had time to fertilize. 

Interestingly, I noticed that the colors of bundles from C and D were distinctly different. C bundles were consistently dark brown and D bundles were a mix of light brown to dark brown.

This was really interesting! 

After fertilization, the sperm water was removed and embryos were rinsed with 1 µm FSW. Embryos were then added to n=3 conicals for each symbiont type: conicals C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, and D3. Embryos were divided approximately equally for each pool across the three conicals by FD at 22:00-22:30. 

The conicals were then drained ~90% to provide an additional embryo rinse. Water was then turned on at ~7-8 mL per 5 seconds (84-96 mL per min) and allowed to fill. The banjo filters were placed in each conical. This was done between 22:40 and 22:55. 

Note that due to the amount of gametes available the C coral conicals are more dense than the D corals. Tomorrow we will do a count estimate to see how many larvae are in each conical. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/master/images/NotebookImages/Hawaii2023/conical1.jpeg) 

Every 60 minutes or so Ariana will check the cultures, stir/swirl the embryos, check water flow, and bubble bump the embryos off of the banjo filter. Conicals were fully refilled by 00:15. 

Cultures looked clean and healthy all through the night and into the early morning.  

## Environmental measurements

Ariana and Jill recorded environmental measurements in the larval conicals.

## Developmental time series sampling 

Jill and Ariana loaded tubes for Jill's project and conducted sampling of fertilized egg and 4 hour post fertilization time points. See Jill's notebook for details. 

# 16 June 2023 

## Set up 

Jill and Ariana arrived at HIMB and worked on unpacking supplies and preparing equipment. Ariana filled liquid nitrogen at University of Hawaii at Manoa in the dry shipper. The dry shipper was fully charged and then filled with liquid to act as a dewar for our field work. 

The lab space was cleaned and organized. 

## Spawning protocols and overview   

We expect that spawning may occur tonight (June 16), tomorrow (June 17), or Sunday (June 18). We will be doing the following activities tonight if spawning occurs. 

We will first place nets over the parent colonies. The Coral Resilience Lab (CRL) has collected coral colonies with known symbiont communities and we will collect gametes from those that are dominated (>90%) by either *Cladocopium* or *Durusdinium* according to previous ITS2 sequencing in the CRL. Symbiont community of the parents is passed to the offspring as indicated by previous CRL data. These colonies are kept in flow through tanks until spawning. 

Before spawning (about 8pm) we will place nets over the colonies with buoyant collection cups. During the spawning window (20:45-21:15), the colonies will release gametes that will float into the collection cups. Those cups will then be brought into the lab where we will pool gametes within parent symbiont type and allow for eggs and sperm to separate and fertilize. This will be conducted in falcon tubes with approximately 5 mL of gametes in 45 mL of filtered seawater (1 µm FSW). 

After about 1 hour of fertilization (~23:00), one falcon tube of fertilized eggs will be added into 1 20 L conical rearing containers in the CRL. These conicals are equiped with flow through FSW (1 µm) and banjo filters (123 µm mesh). 

Before adding to the conicals, the sperm and water will be removed with a seriological pipette and rinsed once with FSW. The fertilized eggs will then be gently poured into the conicals. 
  
We will use n=3 conicals for *Cladocopium* dominated larvae (C) and n=3 for *Durudinium* dominated larvae (D). 

During the first few days of rearing, the larvae will have constant "babysitting" by CRL and our researchers. Every hour, embryos will be checked to remove dead material (using a transfer pipette), clean the surface of the water (using a gentle wipe of a kim wipe across the surface), and check water flow and gently "bubble bump" the embryos off the bottom of the conical using a tube attached to a bulb. 

If needed after a few days of development, we will evenly re distrubute the embryos across the conical tanks prior to the start of experiments. 

During spawning, we will record which parents contributed to each pool and in which proportions. 

Jill Ashey will also be conducting spawning research and will be collecting a developmental time series for molecular and physiological measurements. Full details will be recorded in her notebook.  

## Logger launch

Hobo Tidbit loggers (n=6) were deployed in two incubators to check incubator accuracy. We placed one logger on each of three shelves in two incubators, one set at 30°C and one set at 27°C. After running for 1.5 hours, we checked the temperature loggers. We found that the average of the 30°C was 30.68° and the average temprature of the 27°C incubator was 26.87°C. But there was variation by 0.8-1.1°C between shelves, with the top shelf being the warmest and the lowest shelf the coolest. This is becuase the incubators were filled with falcon tubes for developmental sampling, so there was limited airflow. We will reduce the number of falcon tubes in the incubators and rotate the falcon tubes between shelfs during the sampling time series to account for these effects. 

## Preparing incubators 

Incubators were plugged in, set up, 

## Jill's project - developmental time series 

We prepared supplies for Jill's project today including labeling tubes and boxes, preparing falcon tubes, and discussing sampling protocols. Full details are recorded in her notebooks.  

## Spawning 

Overall spawning was light tonight, as expected. This is a good sign that spawning will likely happen on Saturday or Sunday nights. Here are some more details: 

### Wildtype: Developmental time series 

CRL's field team went to Reef 13 in Kaneohe Bay to collect gametes from wildtype spawning slicks. They reported that spawning was light and they were able to collect some gametes for preliminary testing. We used two falcon tubes of gametes (5 mL gametes per tube in 40 mL FSW) for density testing for Jill's developmental time series. Falcon tubes were allowed to incubate on the bench top until all bundles were broken at approximately 11pm. We then loaded falcon tubes at different densities (n=3 per density level) by adding 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 µL of concentrated fertilized eggs to each tube with 40 mL of FSW. We calculated the number of embryos added by counting the number of embryos in three 5 µL samples from the concentrated embryos. 

There were an average of 75 embryos in 5 µL sample, which is equal to 1,500 in 100 µL and 15,000 in a 1 mL sample. This is very close to estimates provided by CRL (estimated 14,000 in 1 mL concentrated fertilized egg sample). On our gradient, we therefore added 150, 750, 1,500, 3,000, and 7,500 embryos to our tubes. 

CRL has previously reared embryos in falcon tubes and recommended adding 100-200 µL to each falcon tube and resting it on its side to provide the greatest surface area. CRL did one water change within 12-24 h after fertilization and obtained viable embryos after 4 days. 

We will check these tubes at 4 hours post fertilization (3am) and 9 hours post fertilization (8am) for viability. Tomorrow we will also practice the sampling procedure for collecting molecular and physiology samples from tubes at each time point. 

### C and D colonies 

For our project on symbiont community identity in larvae, we have n=15 parents dominated by Durusdinium (and are bleaching resistant - AKA non-bleached phenotype) and n=13 parents dominated by Cladocopium (and are bleaching sensitive - AKA bleached phenotype). We placed nets over the colonies at 18:45pm that are equipped with funnels and falcon tubes with stoppers that are made buoyant by foam attachments.

We then monitored for spawning from 20:45pm-21:15pm. Two colonies released a light to moderate amount of bundles. We did not use any material from these colonies tonight. We will look for more spawning tomorrow!
