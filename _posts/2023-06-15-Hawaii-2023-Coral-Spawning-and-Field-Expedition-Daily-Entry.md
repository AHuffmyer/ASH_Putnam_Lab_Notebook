This post includes the full notebook for June-July 2023 *Montipora capitata* coral spawning and field expedition in Hawaii at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. These notebook posts by A. Huffmyer are updated in order of most recent to oldest. 

Field expedition team members: Jill Ashey (URI), Jennifer Matthews (UT Sydney), Andrei Herdean (UT Sydney), Crawford Drury and Coral Resilience Lab (HIMB).  

# Project Overview  

The goal of this field expedition is to conduct research on larval thermal tolerance in *Montipora capitata* larvae hosting different symbiont genera. *M. capitata* is a vertically transmitting coral and passes symbionts to offspring through the gametes. This work is funded in part through the National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to AH and the University of Washington eScience Data Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to AH. More information on the abstract of the NSF OCE PRF award can be [found here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2205966&HistoricalAwards=false). 

Below is a visual overview of our project: 

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/master/images/NotebookImages/Hawaii2023/overview.png)  

The goal for this expedition is to answer the following question  - *How does symbiont community identity impact thermal tolerance and larval energy usage under stress?*     

We will address this question by measuring: 

- Larval photosynthesis-irradiance curves and photophysiology
- Larval thermal performance curves: respiration and photophysiology 
- Larval gene expression
- Larval lipidomics
- Larval metabolomics   

# 16 June 2023 

## Set up 

Jill and Ariana arrived at HIMB and worked on unpacking supplies and preparing equipment. Ariana filled liquid nitrogen at University of Hawaii at Manoa in the dry shipper. The dry shipper was fully charged and then filled with liquid to act as a dewar for our field work. 

The lab space was cleaned and organized. 

## Spawning protocols and overview   

We expect that spawning may occur tonight (June 16), tomorrow (June 17), or Sunday (June 18). We will be doing the following activities tonight if spawning occurs. 

We will first place nets over the parent colonies. The Coral Resilience Lab (CRL) has collected coral colonies with known symbiont communities and we will collect gametes from those that are dominated (>90%) by either *Cladocopium* or *Durusdinium* according to previous ITS2 sequencing in the CRL. Symbiont community of the parents is passed to the offspring as indicated by previous CRL data. These colonies are kept in flow through tanks until spawning. 

Before spawning (about 8pm) we will place nets over the colonies with buoyant collection cups. During the spawning window (8:45pm-9:15pm), the colonies will release gametes that will float into the collection cups. Those cups will then be brought into the lab where we will pool gametes within parent symbiont type and allow for eggs and sperm to separate and fertilize. This will be conducted in falcon tubes with approximately 5 mL of gametes in 45 mL of filtered seawater (1 µm FSW). 

After about 1 hour of fertilization (~11:00pm), one falcon tube of fertilized eggs will be added into 1 20 L conical rearing containers in the CRL. These conicals are equiped with flow through FSW (1 µm) and banjo filters (123 µm mesh). 

Before adding to the conicals, the sperm and water will be removed with a seriological pipette and rinsed once with FSW. The fertilized eggs will then be gently poured into the conicals. 
  
We will use n=3 conicals for *Cladocopium* dominated larvae (C) and n=3 for *Durudinium* dominated larvae (D). 

During the first few days of rearing, the larvae will have constant "babysitting" by CRL and our researchers. Every hour, embryos will be checked to remove dead material (using a transfer pipette), clean the surface of the water (using a gentle wipe of a kim wipe across the surface), and check water flow and gently "bubble bump" the embryos off the bottom of the conical using a tube attached to a bulb. 

If needed after a few days of development, we will evenly re distrubute the embryos across the conical tanks prior to the start of experiments. 

During spawning, we will record which parents contributed to each pool and in which proportions. 

Jill Ashey will also be conducting spawning research and her notebook is available [here](). 

## Logger launch

Hobo Tidbit loggers (n=6) were deployed in two incubators to check incubator accuracy. We placed one logger on each of three shelves in two incubators, one set at 30°C and one set at 27°C. After running for 1.5 hours, we checked the temperature loggers. We found that the average of the 30°C was 30.68° and the average temprature of the 27°C incubator was 26.87°C. But there was variation by 0.8-1.1°C between shelves, with the top shelf being the warmest and the lowest shelf the coolest. This is becuase the incubators were filled with falcon tubes for developmental sampling, so there was limited airflow. We will reduce the number of falcon tubes in the incubators and rotate the falcon tubes between shelfs during the sampling time series to account for these effects. 

## Preparing incubators 

Incubators were plugged in, set up, 

## Jill's project - developmental time series 

We prepared supplies for Jill's project today including labeling tubes and boxes, preparing falcon tubes, and discussing sampling protocols. Full details on her project can be found [in her notebook here]().  

## Spawning 

Overall spawning was light tonight, as expected. This is a good sign that spawning will likely happen on Saturday or Sunday nights. Here are some more details: 

### Wildtype: Developmental time series 

CRL's field team went to Reef 13 in Kaneohe Bay to collect gametes from wildtype spawning slicks. They reported that spawning was light and they were able to collect some gametes for preliminary testing. We used two falcon tubes of gametes (5 mL gametes per tube in 40 mL FSW) for density testing for Jill's developmental time series. Falcon tubes were allowed to incubate on the bench top until all bundles were broken at approximately 11pm. We then loaded falcon tubes at different densities (n=3 per density level) by adding 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 µL of concentrated fertilized eggs to each tube with 40 mL of FSW. We calculated the number of embryos added by counting the number of embryos in three 5 µL samples from the concentrated embryos. 

There were an average of 75 embryos in 5 µL sample, which is equal to 1,500 in 100 µL and 15,000 in a 1 mL sample. This is very close to estimates provided by CRL (estimated 14,000 in 1 mL concentrated fertilized egg sample). On our gradient, we therefore added 150, 750, 1,500, 3,000, and 7,500 embryos to our tubes. 

CRL has previously reared embryos in falcon tubes and recommended adding 100-200 µL to each falcon tube and resting it on its side to provide the greatest surface area. CRL did one water change within 12-24 h after fertilization and obtained viable embryos after 4 days. 

We will check these tubes at 4 hours post fertilization (3am) and 9 hours post fertilization (8am) for viability. Tomorrow we will also practice the sampling procedure for collecting molecular and physiology samples from tubes at each time point. 

### C and D colonies 

For our project on symbiont community identity in larvae, we have n=15 parents dominated by Durusdinium (and are bleaching resistant - AKA non-bleached phenotype) and n=13 parents dominated by Cladocopium (and are bleaching sensitive - AKA bleached phenotype). We placed nets over the colonies at 6:45pm that are equipped with funnels and falcon tubes with stoppers that are made buoyant by foam attachments.

We then monitored for spawning from 8:45pm-9:15pm. Two colonies released a light to moderate amount of bundles. We did not use any material from these colonies tonight. We will look for more spawning tomorrow!
