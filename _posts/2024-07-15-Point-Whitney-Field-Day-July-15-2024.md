This post details activities at Point Whitney from 15 July 2024.

# Overview 

Today I ran the weekly broodstock stressor and picked up oysters to bring to UW tomorrow.   

## Probe measurements 

Measurements are on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements.csv).  

Stressor measurements are on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements_weekly_stressors.csv).  

## Broodstock weekly stressors 

Broodstock from bags 99 and 100 were added to a bucket with fresh water from 11:00-11:30.  

## Taking oysters for UW

I collected all bags for Effort E (n=4 bags), Effort D (n=4 bags), and Effort B (n=4 bags) seed to take to UW tomorrow.  

I also counted out 150 seed from each of the 10 bags of 10K seed from all treatments and put in new seed bags to take to UW.  

## 10K seed stressor 

I exposed the 10K seed immune treatment to the existing PolyIC solution from 11:00-13:00.
