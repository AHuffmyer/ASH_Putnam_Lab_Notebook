title: Tissue Homogenization for Nucleic Acid Analysis
---

Protocol for the homogenization of tissues by grinding on liquid nitrogen to maintain nucleic acid integrity and produce a homogenous tissue distribution for each downstream assay.
Yields tissue powder that is stored at -80°C for downstream analyses.

# Procedure
* Wash mortar, pestle, spatula, and funnel and rinse with RNAse zap, rinse with DEPC treated water
* Chill mortar, pestle, and spatula by adding liquid nitrogen
* Remove any extra liquid from sample and add sample to liquid nitrogen in mortar 
* Crush and grind sample until powder is formed
* Add additional liquid nitrogen as necessary to ensure sample remains frozen. 
* Chill funnel in liquid nitrogen
* Add homogenate powder to microfuge tubes
* Store tubes at -80°C until ready for downstream processing
