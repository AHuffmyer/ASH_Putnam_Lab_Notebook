This post summarizes field activities to assess growth and survival of oyster outplants at Westcott Shellfish on San Juan Island.  

# Field Work 

Today Grace L. and I assessed growth and survival and maintained outplants at Westcott. Here are the things that we did:  

- Clean all bags 
- Download and clean all temperature loggers 
- Take images of all oysters for size analysis 
- Manually measured length, width, and depth of n=10 oysters per bag for volume models 
- Counted the number of dead oysters per bag 

We processed 32 total bags today. There were no missing bags and no issues to note.  

Grace will return in about a month to move oysters into larger mesh bags.  

All images of data sheets and temperature logger files have been uploaded to GitHub [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main/data/outplanting/GoosePoint).  

Here are some field pictures from today.

# Temperature loggers 

I downloaded and ran temperature data for the Westcott site. Here are the temperatures from this deployment.
