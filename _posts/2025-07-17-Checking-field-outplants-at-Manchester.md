This post details checking on our field deployments for our Manchester hardening experiment at the Manchester NOAA station.

## Overview 

In this project, we conducted a 2-week thermal hardening of seed provided by the USDA ARS POGS program.     

Oysters were exposed to the following conditions:  

- Control: Ambient temperatures (approx. 14-16°C)
- Treated: Daily exposure to elevated 25°C temperatures for approx. 5 hours

After 2 weeks of these treatments, oysters are going to be outplanted at Manchester on the docks in SEPA cages to assess survival and growth over the summer.  

Oysters were outplanted on June 16, 2025. Today we performed a 1-month check up and moved oysters into larger bags.   

## Checking bags 

Today we removed the outer bag, leaving oysters in the larger, inner bag. We removed the zip ties and ties the bags so that there was more room in the bags for oysters to grow. 

Oysters have grown quite a bit over the last month! We did not notice any survival.  

In about 1 more month we will take images for growth and count for survival.

## Temperature loggers

I downloaded temperature loggers and plotted temperature data from the deployment so far.  

Loggers log temperature (°C) every 10 minutes throughout the deployment.  

| logger   | tank | treatment | header | field_tag |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 22105353 | 3    | Control   | 1      | R008      |
| 22105354 | 1    | High      | 2      | B028      |
| 22105356 | 4    | Control   | 1      | G058      |
| 22105358 | 2    | High      | 2      | R013      |
