This post summarizes field activities to assess growth and survival of oyster outplants at Goose Point Oysters in South Bend, WA.  

# Field Work 

Today I assessed growth and survival and maintained outplants at Goose Point. Here are the things that we did:  

- Goose Point folks power washed all bags to remove high barnacle set
- Download and cleaned all temperature loggers (removed barnacles)
- Took images of all oysters for size analysis 
- Counted the number of dead oysters per bag 

I processed 14 total bags today. There were no missing bags and no issues to note. Other than a heavy barnacle set, everything looked good.    

Juan recommended doing another assessment in late July/early August and he will update us if they start to see any mortality. They are interested in viewing temperature and growth data as well.  

All images of data sheets and temperature logger files have been uploaded to GitHub [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main/data/outplanting/GoosePoint).  

Here are some field pictures from today.

# Temperature loggers 

I downloaded and ran temperature data for the Goose Point site. Here are the temperatures from this deployment.
