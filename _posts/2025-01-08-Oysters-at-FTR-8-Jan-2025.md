Today I moved oysters from Point Whitney to UW in FTR for lab research and testing. 

## Overview

A post that details oysters and transport from Point Whitney is available [in my notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Point-Whitney-Field-Day-7-Jan-2025/). 

Oysters were transported in a cooler with ice and added to tanks in FTR today. 

## Broodstock 

The adult broodstock were added to tanks with one bag per blue tank. I combined some of the seed together and gave the adults their own crate for holding.  

These will be moved to Manchester/NOAA in a couple of weeks, so holding here is temporary.

## PolyIC seed 

I took the seed out of their mesh packets and put them in silos. There are four silos in the tanks, each labeled with the treatment group using zip ties and paper tags. Each blue tank has one treated group and one control group to account for any tank effects in FTR.

## Water change and feeding 

I did a 5 gallon bucket water change and adjusted salinity to approx. 24-25 ppt.  

I added food to both tanks and poured water into the silos to ensure the spat would get access to food. 

I'll do probe measurements regularly in these tanks.  

## To do on Thursday/Friday of this week 

The cold room temperature was set at 18°C, which is too warm for our tanks. Steven is going to start chillers in the tanks tomorrow while we wait for a work order to fix the cold room chiller.  

Ideally, we would like the the temperature to be ~ 10°C.  

**To do Thursday/Friday (Steven)**: 

- Check the oysters in tanks to see if the new oysters have any major mortality (there was one dead shell in an adult bag when I dropped them off, so that is expected). 
- Start chillers and set to 10°C in each tank if possible. 
- Add food if the water looks clear, since the adults may eat more than the seed have been. 
- Move the silos up and down in the tanks to gently move the seed around and ensure they get some water exchange.
