This post details RNA extraction protocols for the 2023 Moorea Symbiotic Exchange project, which contains both larval and recruit samples.  

# RNA Extraction Protocol 

This protocol is based on Jill's extraction [protocol](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-07-21-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md). This post details RNA extraction protocols for samples taken during the [2023 Symbiotic Exchange](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023) project. 

### Samples 

Samples include larvae preserved in RNA/DNA shield as well as clippings from recruit corals preserved in RNA/DNA shield.

### Protocol 

#### Sample prep and homogenization: Larvae

- Obtain dry ice for the Bullet Blender bead beater. 

- Thaw samples in an ice bucket. 

- Transfer sample to a labeled 1.5 mL Safe-Lock tube. 

- Add more RNA/DNA shield to the sample to bring total volume to 1000 µL. 

- Spin down tubes so there are no bubbles in lid 

- Add ~50 uL of glass beads (0.5mm) into sample tubes (enough to cover the bottom of the tube) 

- Place Safe-Lock tubes in specified Bullet Blender adapters. Fill Bullet Blender with dry ice and pre cool. 

- Bead beat tubes at high speed (8) for 4 minutes. 

- Spin down at 3000 rcf in a centrifuge for 1 minute. 

- Remove 500 µL of liquid sample from the safe-lock sample tube into a new tube to proceed with extraction. Save the leftover bead beat sample with beads at -80°C. 

#### Sample prep: Recruit fragments 

- Obtain dry ice for the Bullet Blender bead beater. 

- Thaw samples in an ice bucket. 

- Transfer sample (including fragment) to a labeled 1.5 mL Safe-Lock tube. 

- Add more RNA/DNA shield to the sample to bring total volume to 1000 µL. 

- Place Safe-Lock tubes in specified Bullet Blender adapters. Fill Bullet Blender with dry ice and pre cool.   

- Bead beat tubes at high speed (8) for 4 minutes. 

- Spin down at 3000 rcf in a centrifuge for 1 minute.

- Remove 500 µL of liquid sample from the safe-lock sample tube into a new tube to proceed with extraction. Save the leftover bead beat sample with beads at -80°C. 

#### Lysis 

- Make DNase rxn mix 
	- To make DNase rxn mix: 
		- DNA digestion buffer: 75 µL x _____ samples = _____ buffer needed
		- DNase I: 		 5 µL x _____ samples = _____ DNase I needed
	- DNase I is stored at -20°C
	- Combine in 1.5 mL tube and invert gently to mix
	- Make for each batch or make in advance and freeze
	- Store at -20°C

- Add 50 uL of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) and 25 uL of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.

- Vortex. Incubate on counter for 30 min. Spin down.   

- Add 575 uL of lysis buffer (1:1 ratio of sample:lysis buffer) to each sample. The volume in each tube should be 1150 uL. 

- Vortex and spin down. 

- Transfer 700 uL of the sample into the corresponding yellow DNA spin column. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm.

- Move the liquid collected in the collection tube into a labeled 5 mL tube. This is your RNA!  

- Transfer the remainder of the sample (~450 uL) into the yellow DNA spin column. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm.

- Move the liquid collected in the collection tube into the labeled 5 mL tube to combine with the liquid from the last spin. This is your RNA! Set this aside until RNA extraction steps.

- The DNA remains on the filter of the yellow DNA spin column.  

#### DNA extraction

- Warm tris to 70°C in a heating block. 

- Move yellow DNA column to new collection tube and discard the old one. 

- Add 400 uL of prep buffer. Cenrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 700 uL of wash buffer. Cenrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Cenrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Centrifuge columns dry for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. 

- Move yellow DNA spin column into final labeled gDNA 1.5 mL tube ("ID gDNA Date"). 

- Add 40 µL of warm Tris (70°C) to spin column. Let columns sit for 5 minutes at room temperature. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. DO THIS TWICE! Total elution volume = 80 µL

- Store the gDNA at -20°C. 

#### RNA extraction

- Warm RNA/DNA free water to 56°C in a warming block. 

- Add 1150 uL of 100% EtOH (1:1 ratio of sample:ethanol) to the 5 mL tube with the RNA. Pipette up and down to mix. 

- Transfer 700 uL of sample into the green RNA spin column. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Repeat the above step until all liquid has been moved from the 5 mL tube. 

- Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 80 uL of DNase mix to each spin column. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. 

- Add 400 uL of prep buffer. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 700 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Centrifuge columns dry for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. 

- Move green RNA spin column into final RNA 1.5 mL tube ("ID RNA"). 

- Add 40 µL of warmed DNA/RNA free water (56°C) to spin column. Let columns sit for 5 minutes. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. DO THIS TWICE! Total elution volume = 80 µL

- Prepare Qubit reagents during incubation waiting periods. 

- Proceed directly to QC. Store the RNA at -80°C if not proceeding to QC. 

### QC 

QC using the Qubit High Sensitivity RNA assay.   

- Remove kit standards from the fridge.  

- Set up the required number of Qubit 0.5 mL tubes (n=1 per sample with 2 additional for the 2 standards). Label teh lids of the Qubit tubes with the sample numbers and "S1"/"S2" for the standards.  

- Prepare Qubit working solution. The final volume is 200 µL. Samples will have 1 µL of sample and standards will have 10µL of standard. 

	- Samples: 199 µL x _____ samples = _____ solution needed
	- Standards: 190 µL x _____ samples = _____ solution needed
	- Total = _______ solution needed + 10% = ______ total solution
	- HS Qubit Reagent total volume = _____ total solution * (1/200) = ______ HS Reagent Volume
	- HS Qubit buffer total volume = total ______ solution needed - _______ HS Reagent volume 

	- For example: 

	- Samples: 199 µL x 10 samples = 1990 µL solution needed
	- Standards: 190 µL x 2 samples = 380 µL solution needed
	- Total = 2370 µL solution needed + 10% = 2607 µL total solution
	- HS Qubit Reagent total volume = 2607 µL total solution * (1/200) = 13.04 µL HS Reagent Volume
	- HS Qubit buffer total volume = total 2607 µL solution needed - 13.04 HS Reagent volume = 2594 µL buffer 

- Add 190 µL of working solution to the S1 and S2 standard tubes. 

- Add 10 µL (exactly!) of Standard 1 to the S1 tube and 10 µL of Standard 2 to the S2 tube. 

- Vortex. 

- Add 199 µL to all sample Qubit tubes. 

- Add 1 µL of sample to respective Qubit sample tubes. 

- Vortex.  

- Incubate tubes at room temperature for 2 min. 

- Read standards

	- On the Qubit (3.0), press "RNA", then "RNA: High Sensitivity". Press "Read standards". 
	- Insert the S1 tube. Press "Read standard". Remove. 
	- Insert the S2 tube. Press "Read standard". Remove. 
	- Record calibration information.  

- Run samples 

	- Select the sample volume and units (200 µL total, 199 µL working solution, 1 µL sample) 
	- Select ng/µL units. 
	- Insert a sample tube and press "Read tube". Remove the tube when done. 
	- Record the data - include the top value (concentration) and the bottom value (dilution concentration). 
	- Repeat to read all samples. Record the order in which you read all samples. 

### Prep for sending for sequencing 

- Package with dry ice and provide sequencing facility with required metadata

- Follow sequencing facility instructions for shipment

### Tips and tricks 

- Start with small test batches to troublshoot 

- I recommend no more than 10 samples in a single batch 

- Prep all tubes and boxes before starting 

- Print out protocol 

- Clean everything before starting with ethanol and RNAase spray before starting and between batches 

- Every 5 min do RNAase and ethanol washes on gloves and surfaces
