This post details RNA extraction protocols for the 2023 Moorea Symbiotic Exchange project, which contains both larval and recruit samples.  

# RNA Extraction Protocol 

This protocol is based on Jill's extraction [protocol](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-07-21-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md). This post details RNA extraction protocols for samples taken during the [2023 Symbiotic Exchange](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023) project. 

### Samples 

Samples include larvae preserved in RNA/DNA shield as well as clippings from recruit corals preserved in RNA/DNA shield.  

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus [Kit and Protocol](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf)
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70°C
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Sample tube freezer boxes (1 for RNA and 1 for DNA)
- Plastics 
	- 3 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample 
	- 1 PCR tube per sample
	- 1 Qubit tube per sample 
	- 1 5 mL tubes per sample 
- Beads for bead beating [RPI Glass disruption beads](https://www.rpicorp.com/products/laboratory-equipment/homogenizers/disruption-beads-for-yeast-fungi-0-5mm-glass-2-5-g-cc-454-gm.html) 

### Protocol 

#### Sample prep and homogenization: Larvae

- Thaw samples in an ice bucket. 

- Spin down tubes so there are no bubbles in lid 

- Add ~50 uL of glass beads (0.5mm) into sample tubes (enough to cover the bottom of the tube) 

- Bead beat tubes at high speed for 2 minutes. 

- Spin down in mini centrifuge for 1 minute 

- Remove 500 uL of liquid sample from the original sample tube into a new tube to proceed with extraction. Save the leftover sample + beads at -80°C. 

#### Sample prep: Recruit fragments 

- Thaw samples in an ice bucket. 

- Depending on the color of the shield pigementation, bead beating may be needed. If the shield is pale, bead beat the sample. 

- Beat beat tubes at high speed for 2 minutes. 

- Spin down in mini centrifuge for 1 minute 

- Remove 500 uL of liquid sample from the original sample tube into a new tube to proceed with extraction. Save the leftover sample + beads at -80°C. 

#### Lysis 

- Add 50 uL of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) and 25 uL of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.

- Vortex and spin down. **Should this include an incubation step? 30 min recommended in Zymo protocol.** 

- Add 575 uL of lysis buffer (1:1 ratio of sample:lysis buffer) to each sample. The volume in each tube should be 1150 uL. 

- Vortex and spin down. 

- Transfer 700 uL of the sample into the corresponding yellow DNA spin column. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm.

- Move the liquid collected in the collection tube into a labeled 5 mL tube. This is your RNA!  

- Transfer the remainder of the sample (~450 uL) into the yellow DNA spin column. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm.

- Move the liquid collected in the collection tube into the labeled 5 mL tube to combine with the liquid from the last spin. This is your RNA! Set this aside until RNA extraction steps.

- The DNA remains on the filter of the yellow DNA spin column.  

#### DNA extraction

- Move yellow DNA column to new collection tube and discard the old one. 

- Add 400 uL of prep buffer. Cenrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 700 uL of wash buffer. Cenrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Cenrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Centrifuge columns dry for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. 

- Move yellow DNA spin column into final labeled gDNA 1.5 mL tube ("ID gDNA Date"). 

- Add 40 µL of warm Tris to spin column. Let columns sit for 5 minutes at room temperature. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. DO THIS TWICE! Total elution volume = 80 µL

- Store the gDNA at -20°C. 

#### RNA extraction

- Add 1150 uL of 100% EtOH (1:1 ratio of sample:ethanol) to the 5 mL tube with the RNA. Pipette up and down to mix. 

- Transfer 700 uL of sample into the green RNA spin column. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Repeat the above step until all liquid has been moved from the 5 mL tube. 

- Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Make DNase rxn mix 
	- To make DNase rxn mix: 
		- DNA digestion buffer: 75 µL x _____ samples = _____ buffer needed
		- DNase I: 		 5 µL x _____ samples = _____ DNase I needed
	- DNase I is stored at -20°C
	- Combine in 1.5 mL tube and invert gently to mix

- Add 80 uL of DNase mix to each spin column. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. 

- Add 400 uL of prep buffer. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 700 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Repeat the wash. Add 400 uL of wash buffer. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. Discard liquid. 

- Centrifuge columns dry for 2 minutes at 16000 rpm. 

- Move green RNA spin column into final RNA 1.5 mL tube ("ID RNA"). 

- Add 40 µL of warmed DNA/RNA free water to spin column. Let columns sit for 5 minutes. Spin for 30 seconds at 16000 rpm. DO THIS TWICE! Total elution volume = 80 µL

- Aliquot 12 µL into one PCR tubes for QC. Store the rest of the RNA at -80°C. 

### QC 

QC using Qubit.  

#### Qubit


### Prep for sending for sequencing 

- Metadata sheet and labeled tubes 

- Send around 70 µL (send the whole tube) 

### Tips and tricks 

- Start with a couple to troubleshoot 

- Can work our way up to doing 10-12 at a time 

- Prep tubes and boxes before starting 

- Print out protocol 

- Clean everything before starting with ethanol and RNAase spray 

- Avoid touching anything and be super sterile 

- Every 5 min do RNAase and ethanol washes on gloves and surfaces
