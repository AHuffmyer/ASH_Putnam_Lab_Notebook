Today Steven and I outplanted oysters at Sequim Bay from the PolyIC project. 

# Overview 

In this project we exposed broodstock oysters to Poly(I:C) immune stress and then reared and conducted experiments on the offspring. The seed from these parent groups are now about 8 months old and are ready to be outplanted.  

All information for this project can be found on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/polyIC-larvae/tree/main).  

All outplant data is available in the [outplant folder here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/polyIC-larvae/tree/main/data/outplant/sequim).  

Today we outplanted the oysters at Sequim Bay. See my [previous post](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Preparing-polyIC-project-outplants-at-Point-Whitney/) on preparing the oysters for outplants.   

# Outplanting 

Outplanting went well today. We put the oysters in 3/8" mesh brood outplant bags with their identifying tags and temperature loggers. Bags were secured with zip ties to the lines. They will be flipped by the beach crew regularly. Tags were secured on the outside of the bags.  

Here is a table with outplant information:
