This post summarizes field activities to conduct the final assessment of oyster growth and survival at Westcott Shellfish on San Juan Island.   

# Field Work 

Today Grace L. and I assessed growth and survival and maintained outplants at Westcott. Here are the things that we did:  

- Took out all racks and cleaned bags
- Downloaded all temperature loggers 
- Take images of all oysters for size analysis 
- Manually measured length, width, and depth of n=8-10 oysters per bag for volume models 
- Counted the number of dead oysters per bag 
- Subsampled oysters for [survival assessments in the lab](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Plan-for-Westcott-Oyster-Survival-Testing/)

We processed 32 total bags today. There were no missing bags and no issues to note.  

We gave all remaining oysters to Westcott.  

All images of data sheets and oysters have been uploaded to GitHub [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main/data/outplanting/Westcott/20251202_images). Temperature logger files are [on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main/data/environmental/loggers/westcott/westcottloggers_20251202).  

To subsample for survival assays, we sampled n=4 oysters per bag for the weekly effort (total n=44 oysters per treatment group) and n=8 oysters per bag for the daily effort (total n=40 oysters per treatment group). Grace is going to hold these in tanks tonight and transport them to UW tomorrow.  

# To do 

- Transport oysters to UW (Grace) 
- Conduct survival assays in the lab (Roberts Lab) 
- Measure growth and record survival (Grace) 
- Plot temperature loggers (Ariana)
- Assemble data to send to Westcott (Ariana & Grace)
