Today we assessed 10K seed outplants at Baywater Shellfish in the Hood Canal, WA and outplanted the remaining PolyIC seed for future assessments. 

# Overview 

In October 2024, we [outplanted 10K seed](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/10K-seed-outplant-at-Baywater/) at Baywater Shellfish in Thorndyke Bay, WA. Today, we are assessing oysters for growth and survival and then redeploying them for the rest of the summer. 

We also outplanted the remaining PolyIC seed, which were also deployed this summer [at Sequim Bay](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Outplanting-polyIC-oysters-at-Sequim-Bay/).  

# 10K seed assessment 

We pulled in all of the cages [that we located last week](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Locating-outplants-at-Baywater/). All 30 bags were still in place on the lines.

We then did the following things for each bag: 

- Empty the bag onto a table
- Count the number of dead oysters and remove any mussels, crabs, empty shells, and other debris
- Imaged all oysters with a scale bar for growth analysis using ImageJ 
- Added a new yellow ID tag 
- Moved oysters into a new clean bag with the new tag 
- Moved loggers into the new bags 

The bags were processed and will be redeployed tomorrow onto lines. Here are some notes from today: 

- Two bags were completely empty. One was open and oysters likely fell out. One was closed but contained no oysters. 
- Some bags had <10 oysters. These oysters were imaged but were not redeployed in new bags. We therefore had 6 bags that were not redeployed (24 bags for the 10K project were redeployed) 
- Some bags had a mixture of large and small oysters. In some cases, we found dead/empty shells either of small or large oysters and we recorded the number of alive/dead for each size. It is likely that the small shells were winter mortality and the large shells are summer mortality. 
- Bags were left at the processing center and will be added back onto the lines tomorrow. Processing occured from ~09:00-12:30 today. 
- Logger batteries were full and memory was only at 30%. 
- Yellow tags were added onto exterior of bags.

# PolyIC Seed Deployment   

Today Steven picked up the PolyIC oysters from Point Whitney and we outplanted at Baywater. The seed were still too small for the bags, so we used the following steps to deploy:  

- Combine the duplicate Control (green tags 49 and 47) and, separately, combien Treated (green tags 45 and 48) mesh bags from Point Whitney dock lines 
- Screened oysters from each treatment though the bag to have one bag of "large" seed 
- Split the remaining seed ("small" seed) between 1-2 mesh seed bags. These seed bags were then placed inside of outplant tumble bags. We will need to return in 1 month or so to remove the mesh bags. 
- We will use images to estimate numbers and size of oysters in each bag. 
- Yellow tags were added to the exterior of bags. 

We have a total of 5 PolyIC bags and therefore a total of  29 bags at Baywater.

# Next steps 

- Return in 1 month to remove mesh bags from PolyIC bags 
- Return in 1-2 months for another assessment for summer survival and growth
