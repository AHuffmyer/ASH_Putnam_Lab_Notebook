This post details metaboloimcs extraction protocols for the 2023 Moorea Symbiotic Exchange project, which contains both larval and recruit samples.  

# Metabolomics Extraction Protocol 

This post details metabolomics extraction protocols for samples taken during the [2023 Symbiotic Exchange](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023) project. 

### Samples 

Samples include snap frozen recruits and larvae. We are processing 57 total samples for this project. The samples include C13 incubated samples as well as C13 dark-incubated samples and C12 control samples.    

### Materials 

Chemicals: 

- LCMS grade water 
- LC or hypergrade Methanol
- Acetonitrile
- Formic acid 
- Ammonium bicarbonate

Supplies:  

- Microtip sonicator for homogenization
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Sample tube freezer boxes (3-4 boxes)
- Plastics 
	- 4 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample, labeled 
	- 2 Autosampler vials per sample, labeled 
- 70% ethanol
- 10% bleach 
- Autoclave
- P1000, P200, P20, P10 pipettes 
- Standard consumables (gloves, KimWipes, etc.)
- Glass dounces
- Alconox/Liquinox laboratory detergent 

### Protocol 

Proceed with samples in the following order: 

1. C12 samples
2. C13 dark samples
3. C13 samples in random order 

#### Prepare tubes 

Prepare labeled tubes for samples 1-57.  

##### Homogenization/preparation 

1.5 mL tubes = 2 

"#" (homogenization)
"#-Host" (host fraction) 

##### Extraction 

1.5 mL tubes = 2 

"#-1" 
"#-2" 

Autosampler vials = 2 

"#-A Huffmyer"
"#-B Huffmyer"

#### Sample prep, homogenization, and fractionation: Recruits 

- Get small batches of samples from the freezer (2-3 at a time at most). 

- Using cleaned (using ethanol follwed by bleach) clippers, remove a 1 cm2 area of tissue and place into a labeled 1.5 mL tube. Return to the freezer if not proceeding with homogenization immediately. Do this on ice. 

- Add 200 µL ice cold LCMS grade water.

- Place on ice between all steps.  

- Sonicate sample for 30 sec.

- Wipe the sonicator tip with 10% bleach, 70% ethanol, and DI water after each sample. 

- Spin at 3,000g for 5 min at 4°C. 

- Remove supernatant and place in a new labeled tube ("host" tube). Record volume. If needed repeat a second time. 

- Place in a freezer box and store at -80°C until extraction.  

#### Sample prep, homogenization, and fractionation: Larvae

- Thaw samples on ice. Work in small batches so that samples are not thawed for longer than required. 

- Add 200 µL ice cold LCMS grade water to the sample and transfer to a new 1.5 mL tube.

- Place on ice between all steps.  

- Sonicate sample for 30 sec.

- Wipe the sonicator tip with 10% bleach, 70% ethanol, and DI water after each sample. 

- Spin at 3,000g for 5 min at 4°C. 

- Remove supernatant and place in a new labeled tube ("host" tube). Record volume. If needed repeat a second time.

- Place in a freezer box and store at -80°C until extraction.

#### Prepare extraction buffers and supplies 

##### Equipment

Before each batch, thoroughly clean glassware (dounces).  

- After use, rinse with DI water thoroughly followed by a thorough rinse with methanol.  

- Rinse thoroughly with DI water.  

- Repeat a methanol rinse and DI water rinse. 

- Do a final rinse with LCMS grade water. 

- Dry on a clean surface. 

##### Extraction buffer 

This extraction buffer is a ratio of 40:40:20 of methanol, acetonitrile, and water, with 0.5%[v/v] Formic Acid. 

For a total of 200 mL extraction buffer:

- 80 mL methanol
- 80 mL acetonitrile
- 40 mL water
- 1 mL formic acid

Store at 4°C in a non-flammable fridge. 

##### 15% Ammonium Bicarbonate 

Solubility of Ammonium bicarbonate in water is: 220 g/L for 100%  

- 100% Ammonium Bicarbonate solution (250 mL)
	- 55g dry Ammonium bicarbonate in 250 mL LCMS water

- 15% Ammonium Bicarbonate Solution (250 mL)
	- 37.5 mL of 100% Ammonium Bicarbonate Solution + 212.5 mL LCMS water

Store at 4°C in a non-flammable fridge. 

#### Metabolite extraction

- Work in small batches with the number of dounces available. 

- Keep samples on dry ice. 

- Add sample (pipette from tube) into the ice cold douce with 500 µL of ice cold extraction buffer. Sit on dry ice for 5 minutes.

- Homogenize for 1 minute on dry ice in the dounce using the glass dounce. 

- Transfer the liquid into a new 1.5 mL tube ("#-1").  

- Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 15,000g at 4°C. 

- Remove 500 µL of the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube ("#-2"). 

- Add 44 µL of 15% ammonium bicarbonate. 

- Vortex and spin down in a mini centrifuge. 

- Add 100 µL from tube "#-2" into duplicate labeled autosampler vials ("#-A Huffmyer" and "#-B Huffmyer". 

- Store the tubes ("Extraction extras box") and autosampler vials ("Metabolite extracts box") in the freezer at -80°C.  

#### Sample storage and shipment 

- Parafilm and secure the "Metabolite extracts box" with autosampler vials. Clearly label with name, date, and experiment. 

- Coordinate with facility to ship samples using overnight FedEx shipment. 

- Send in a box with dry ice (~10 lbs). 

- Once data is obtained, discard of other extraction tubes.
