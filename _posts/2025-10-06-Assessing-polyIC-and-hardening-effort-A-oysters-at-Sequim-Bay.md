Today I took images and assessed oysters at Sequim Bay from the PolyIC project and Effort A of our hardening efforts. 

# Overview 

All information for the PolyIC project can be found on our [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/polyIC-larvae/tree/main) and information on hardenign efforts can be [found in our repo here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main).   

Today I took images and counted dead oysters in n=8 bags of PolyIC oysters [from July 2025 outplants](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Outplanting-polyIC-oysters-at-Sequim-Bay/) and n=8 bags of Effort A oysters that were [assessed back in June 2025](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Sequim-Bay-Outplants-Size-Analysis/). 

All data is available under `outplanting` directories in the repos linked above.  

# Poly IC outplants  

We have 8 bags outplanted for the PolyIC project at Sequim identified with exterior green small sheep tags (no.  13-20).  

There was little mortality - a couple bags had one or two dead oysters. 

There has been a lot of growth since our outplant!

# Effort A outplants  

We have 8 bags outplanted for the Effort A project at Sequim identified with interior green small sheep tags (no.  93-100).  

There was little mortality - a couple bags had one or two dead oysters like the PolyIC bags. The oysters are large - growth was high this summer.

# Loggers 

I downloaded n=4 loggers. Here is the temperature data we have for this summer.

# Next steps 

- Image analysis for PolyIC outplants (will create GH Issue)
- Image analysis for Effort A outplants (will create GH Issue)
