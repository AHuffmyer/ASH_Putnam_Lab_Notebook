## Sample dilution 

All gDNA has previously been extracted and quantified by Jill detailed in these posts: [xxx](xxx), [xxx](xxx), [xxx](xxx).

Today we diluted gDNA samples in preparation for ITS2 amplification and preparation for sequencing. Dilution is performed to standardize the amount of input in each reaction. Samples were diluted to a concentration of 4ng/uL with the exception of two samples, which had concentrations lower than 4ng/uL in the original gDNA. For these samples, we diluted to 3ng/uL and we will increase the input volume to have a total of 4ng gDNA input for every reaction.  

We diluted to a total volume of 10uL. For several samples, we were unable to obtain a Qubit concentration reading (see previous posts linked above), so for these we based dilutions off of the Nanodrop concentration.  

Dilutions were generated in individually labeled 0.6mL tubes and not in 96-well plates as described in Emma's base protocol. 

We will use Ultrapure H20 as our negative control. Our positive control is an Mcap2020 project sample D18, which was [successfully amplified and sequenced previously]().
