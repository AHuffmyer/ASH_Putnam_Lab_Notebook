This post shows plots from temperature loggers for oyster field sites and outplant sites.  

# Overview  

GitHub repositories for these projects can be found at the following locations:  

- [Oyster stress hardening](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main) 
- [10K seed]()
- [Life stage carryover]()

The plots produced from these scripts can be found for each project in the [oyster stress hardening](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/code/loggers.Rmd) projects and [10K seed hardening]() project.  

## Point Whitney loggers 

We have several groups at Point Whitney: 

- LCO = lifestage carry over project. These are oysters growing out after the temperature hardening conducted by Eric earlier this year. 
- Outdoor = logger in one of the 10-holer tanks accompanying oysters from Pacific Hybreed and Efforts B, D, E, and F. 
- Broodstock = USDA broodstock held in outdoor 10-holer tanks 
- Trays = 2024 USDA seed held in outdoor health trays

Overall, all groups in outdoor trays (efforts B/E/D, LCO, and broodstock) experienced very similar temperatures. Trays with 2024 seed were cooler. Summer temps peaked in late July around 26-27°C.   

*Note that trays were moved to a new stack in August and that is why we see a drop in temperature at this time point.*  

## Westcott loggers 

![](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/NotebookImages/oysters/wsg_usda/temperature/westcott-loggers.png?raw=true)

Overall, loggers at Westcott show huge swings in temperature with maximum temperatures above 40°C and low temperatures at approximately 10°C.

# Goose Point loggers

Overall, loggers at Goose Point are much more stable than Westcott with maximum temperatures reaching 30°C and minimum closer to 11-12°C. 

# 10K Seed loggers

In the lagoon, temperatures reached a max of about 25-26°C in late July with a minimum around 15°C.
