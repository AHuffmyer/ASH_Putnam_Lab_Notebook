Today I prepared samples to transport to UW for RNA and metabolomics processing. 

# Overview

Samples are from the 2023 Moorea Symbiotic Integration project. Details on the project can be [found on GitHub here](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023).  

# Status of all samples

- *DNA samples*: All species ID has been completed from extracted DNA 
- *Larval size*: I have an image of Acropora larvae, but need an image of Pocillopora larvae from Hollie 
- Metabolomics samples: All will be transported to UW 
- *RNA samples*: All will be transported to UW. These are the tubes from which DNA species ID was conducted. They have been stored at -20Â°C. I am taking the original shield samples and extracted DNA is staying at URI. Samples only taken for PR rate corals (those samples for RNA). Original tubes for other DNA samples are staying at URI. 
- *Physiology*: Completed
- *Photosynthesis and respiration*: Completed
- *PI Curves*: Completed
- *Larval respirometry*: Completed
- *Larval RNA*: Samples will be taken to UW for processing 
- *Larval Metabolomics*: Samples will be taken to UW for processing 
- *Larval Physiology*: Samples will be taken to UW for processing
