# Equipment
[Whirlpaks] (https://www.enasco.com/whirlpak/)
Ziplock Bags
Airbrush
Tweezers
Sample Tubes

# Procedure
* Clean and steralize all equipment and use sterile tubes and bags
* Add filtered seawater to the airbrush 
* Place coral into sterile bag
* Use air and liqid to remove tissue which forms a slurry in the bag
* Take Care to avoid back splash from the airbrush, which could cause loss of the tissue 
* Rinse coral skeleton with filtered seawater
* Cut corner from bag and drain into sterile tube
* Rinse bag to collect any remaining tissue
* Save coral for surface area estimation
* Record tissue homogenate volume and store or use in further assays
