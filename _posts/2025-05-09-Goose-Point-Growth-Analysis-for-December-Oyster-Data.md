This post summarizes revised growth analysis for oyster outplants at the Goose Point site from December 2024 measurements. 

# Overview 

Noah K. has analyzed oyster growth data using [his protocol here](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2025/05/06/detailed-protocol-for-oyster-image-analysis/).  

The data set analyzed here is the growth data from images from December 2024 measurements at Goose Point Oysters. We are going to assess these oysters again in May 2025 for updated growth information.  

# Results 

In this project, we conducted two tests. We had a set of oysters exposed to a fresh water stress (with a corresponding control) and those with a temperature stress (with a corresponding control). 

There is a significant but very small difference in growth in the fresh water experiment.

There was also a significant but very small difference in growth in the temperature experiment.

Here is a plot of the model estimates of growth.

There were significant, but very small differences in growth in the December data. This was not present in the September data, so it is possible we will see an increased difference in growth in our May assessments.
