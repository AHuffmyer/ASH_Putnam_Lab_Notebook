This post details the working protocol for PolyIC Seed tests using the resazurin metabolic assay. 

## Overview 

This protocol is written for small oyster spat, but can be adapted for other life stages. This protocol is based on [previous work in the lab by Colby E.](https://genefish.wordpress.com/author/colbyelvrum/) and as used in our analysis of 10K Seed [metabolic response](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Initial-analysis-of-resazurin-metabolic-rates-in-10K-Seed-oysters/) and [survival tests](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/10K-seed-resazurin-survival-analysis/). 

We are using this protocol to test metabolic response of seed oysters to thermal stress that are from parents that were immune primed using [PolyIC exposure](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/categoryview/#polyic-larvae). 

We will expose "treated" and "control" spat to our thermal stress protocol and will measure metabolic response using resazurin and will track survival in a 96-well plate format.  

# Materials and preparing solutions

### 1. Stock resazurin solution 

To make the resazurin stock solution (10 mL) mix the following. We will use this solution for multiple trials.  

- [0.5 g resazurin salt](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R12204)
- 10 mL DI water
- 10 µL DMSO

### 2. Working resazurin solution

To prepare the working solution of resazurin, prepare the following. 

This recipe is to make 150 mL of working stock. To run a single 96 well plate, approximately 35 mL will be required (allowing for extra for re-do's or errors). For example, if we are running 4 total plates, we will need to prepare 4 x 35 mL = 150 mL of working solution. 

- 148 mL DI water 
- 333 µL resazurin stock solution
- 150 µL DMSO
- 1.5 mL antibiotic solution [100x Penn/Strep & 100x Fungizone](https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4648458/null 

### 3. Seawater 

Prepare seawater solution using the FTR tank room hose water and Instant Ocean. Prepare two 500 mL bottles of water. Put one on the counter at control temperature and one in the incubator set to 42°C. These will be used for survival incubations at the end of the day after resazurin measurements. 

### 4. Supplies 

- Two Hobo TidbiT [temperature loggers](https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/data-loggers/mx2203)
	- One placed in incubator and one placed on counter at room temperature 
- 96 well culture plates 
- Paper towels and bench paper/pads 
- Tweezers, transfer pipettes, and forceps 
- Dissecting microscope 
- [Spectrophotometer plate reader]() *add details* 
- P1000 pipette
- Scale bar/ruler

Label plates with identifying number (e.g. "Treated 1", "Control 2").  

# Protocol

## Resazurin measurements 

1. Add 90 spat into a labeled 96 well plate (with a plate number and "resazurin"), all from the same treatment group. Repeat to generate 2-4 plates per treatment group, for a total of 4-8 96 well plates. Leave 6 random wells open for blank measurements. 
2. Record plate number and position of samples in each plate. 
3. Fill each well with 300 µL of resazurin working stock at ambient temperature. 
4. Take a reading for each plate on the plate reader (initial time point). 
5. Put the plates in respective temperature treatments. Put 1-2 plate per treatment group at the 42°C incubation or the countertop ambient incubation (18°C). 
6. After 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours, read the plates again on the plate reader. 

## Survival measurements 

1. After the 4 hour incubation, prepare new labeled plates with the same plate identification numbers and a label with "survival". 
2. Move the samples in the identical positions from the resazurin plate to the survival plate. In the transfer, gently rinse each spat by dunking into a clean seawater from the respective temperature to remove excess resazurin solution. 
3. Fill the wells of the survival plate with 300 µL seawater from the incubator at the respective temperature. 
4. Examine the spat under the scope to view for open shells indicating mortality. 
5. Place all plates in the cold room on the table over night. 
6. The next day (~24 h since start of resazurin measurements), record survival again. 

# Data sheets 

Ariana will add links to data sheets here after initial trials. 

# Notes 

Ariana will conduct a small scale test on 1/8/2025 and will update this protocol after that point and add additional details.
