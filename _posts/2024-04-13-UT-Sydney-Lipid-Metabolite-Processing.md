This post details lipidomics and metabolomics extraction and analysis for samples from the *Montipora capitata* 2023 larval thermal tolerance project at the Unviersity of Technology Sydney in Australia with Dr. Jennifer Matthews. 

See my [notebook posts](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/categoryview/#larval-symbiont-tpc-2023) and my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/larval_symbiont_TPC) for more information on this project. 

Briefly, we will be processing larval samples sampled in summer 2023 of *Montipora capitata* for lipidomics and metabolomics. We will be sampling larvae that were 9 days post fertilization (final time point) incubated at ambient, +3°C, and +6°C for 4 h from wildtype (spawn slick from natural reef), non-bleached (parents that did not bleach under previous bleaching events), and bleached (parents that did bleach under previous bleaching events) parental phenotypes. 

*How does parental history influence metabolic resilience to thermal stress in symbiotic larvae?*  

This post contains a log of main activities. All detailed notes and protocols are recorded in my physical lab notebook (Putnam Lab book #31) and backed up with electronic storage in the Putnam Lab Google Drive. Collaborators have asked that the protocols not be publicly posted until published. 

Overall, this protocol extracts lipids and metabolites simultaneously, which are then individually obtained by a phase separation step. At the end of the protocol, a protein pellet is used for normalization. This results in lipid, metabolite, and protein quantification for each sample.

I arrived at UT Sydney today and stored all samples in the -80°C freezer and delivered fixed larval samples to Jen. Tomorrrow we will begin optimizing protocols.

Today, Jen trained me on the lipid and metabolite extraction protocol using test *Acropora* larvae that she will process for lipid profiles at a later date. We prepared all supplies and reagents that will be used during our work over the next couple of weeks. 

We also discussed modifications that will be made to protocols for our *Montipora capitata* larval samples. The current protocol is for aposymbiotic larvae, and our samples are from symbiotic, vertically transmitting larvae. We are most interested in the host lipid and metabolite profile, because we would like to know how host metabolism and acquisition of translocated products differ depending on parental phenotype and how metabolism and translocation changes under thermal stress.   

This therefore requires that we separate the host and symbiont as best as we can to focus on the host response. This will require revisions to the protocol to include host and symbiont fraction separation prior to lipid and metabolite extraction.  

Currently, the protocol uses protein quantification at the end of the protocol for normalizing lipid and metabolite profiles to sample total protein. If we perform fraction separations before extraction, we need to quantify protein at the start of the assay.  

Therefore, we will optimize the protocol to first remove as much of the symbiont pellet as possible while retaining host lipids followed by protein quantification. We will then use the protein quanitification to proceed with extracting a known amount of tissue protein content as input for lipid and metabolite extractions.

Today, we trialed the protocol modifications discussed above. We used 6 samples from the first time point sampling of Hawaii 2023 larval incubations that can be used as trial sampling. We chose these samples to come from different treatment groups, which will leave n=5 samples if we choose to come back to these samples later on. Our experimental samples are all from the final time point sampling. See notebook posts linked at the top of this post for more information on the project.  

We first performed host and symbiont fraction separations. We first tried 500uL homogenate volume by removing seawater from the sample by pouring onto a GF/F filter and scraping larvae into a tube with MilliQ water. We then homogenized larvae using a plastic pestle and performed two rounds of centrifuging at 3000 rcf for 5 min. After each round of centrifuging, we removed the supernatant and lipid layers above and around the pellet. This will remove a vast majority of symbiont cells, but will likely not remove all, becuase we need to retain the lipid layer, which sticks to the pellet. This shouldn't be a problem due to the detection limit likely not being met for symbiont signals due to low densities. We sampled and will look at homogenate for the host fraction to quantify the number of symbiont cells left in the sample. This will balance the need for separation while retaining as much biomass as possible for sampling.  

We then quantified protein using a Bradford assay and found that samples were below the detection limit. We then performed another round of separations using a 100uL homogenate volume. We also used 0.22 um Millepore filters and a vacuum pump for removing seawater, which worked better with less larval tissue being stuck to the filter. 

We then quantified protein again and found that samples were within detection limits. In our host fraction, we had approx. 50ug of protein in our remaining ~70uL volume. This is lower than Jen prefers for larvae (400ug), but is similar to adult coral values they have used before. If protein values are similar for our experimental samples, we will use the maximum amount possible in the extractions and normalize to the total amount of protein added.
