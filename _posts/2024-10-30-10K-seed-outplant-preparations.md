This post details preparations for outplanting 10K Seed at Baywater shellfish.    

# Overview 

In this project, we exposed oyster seed (*C. gigas*) at the Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery to 5 different stress hardening treatments:  

- Control (no treatment)
- Immune 
- Temperature (35°C)
- Fresh water
- Fresh water at high temperature (35°C)

We conducted the hardening treatments at Point Whitney over the last few months. Now, we are preparing these oysters for outplanting to monitor field performance at Baywater Shellfish in the Hood Canal.   

See my [previous notebook posts here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/categoryview/#10k-seed) for more details on this project.  

This post shows the results of survival curve analysis from metabolic rate incubations using resazurin. For more information on these incubations, [visit Colby's notebook](https://genefish.wordpress.com/author/colbyelvrum/). I'll make a post with a full resazurin protocol soon.  

## Preparing outplants 

Today we prepared 10K seed for outplanting at Baywater Shellfish, which will occur at night on Oct 30th. We counted out three groups of 150 seed from each of the 10 seed bags. This resulted in n=3 groups from each bag. Bags are duplicates of treatments, so we have a total of n=6 groups per treatment.  

Here is the metadata.

We took an image for size of one group of 150 seed per bag for initial size measurements.  

I also launched three temperature loggers to deploy at Baywater.  

- 22023411: new logger 
- 22023406: previously with broodstock, downloaded and relaunched 
- 22023410: previously with lifestage carryover, downloaded and relaunched 

All loggers were launched to log data every 15 minutes starting at 10:00pm on 10/30/2024.  

Finally, I took a subsample of length, width, and depth measurements (recorded in notebook images below) in order to model depth as a function of length and width. We can use this to then infer depth from length and width in size images. I need to enter these data and analyze. 

## LCO size measurements 

I took final size measurements of all LCO oysters and images of spat. The measurements are on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover/data/size/notebook_images/20241029) as notebook images. I need to enter these data and take size measurements from spat images.    

All oysters and shells were disposed of in the lagoon and are now cleaned out.  

## Inventory 

I consolidated all remaining bags of oysters (PH families, Effort C bags) in one 3-holer at Point Whitney. These will remain running over the winter.  

## Sampling juveniles for Mac 

I took ~20 juveniles of the 2024 USDA families in a cooler for Mac.
