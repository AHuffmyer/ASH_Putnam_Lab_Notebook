I did a quick assessment of survival of 10K seed from our assessments yesterday. Here are the results. 

# Overview 

In October 2024, we [outplanted 10K seed](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/10K-seed-outplant-at-Baywater/) at Baywater Shellfish in Thorndyke Bay, WA. Data for this project [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/RobertsLab/10K-seed-Cgigas/). 

We exposed oysters to hardening treatments including: 

- low salinity exposure (FW)
- high temperature exposure (35C)
- low salinity + high temperature exposure (FW 35C)
- polyIC exposure (immune)
- control 

# Survival 

Survival was highly variable and <75% for all bags. There was a trend for lower survival in the immune group (p=0.07), but this is not significant.
