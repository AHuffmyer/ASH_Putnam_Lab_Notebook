This protocol describes the process for taking photographs of preserved coral larvae for measurement of larval size (volume, surface area, length, etc.).  

Protocols developed by Danielle Becker and modified by Ariana Huffmyer.  

# Materials Required

- Pipette  
- Microscope dish  
- Scale bar  
- OMAX compound light microscope  
- [OMAX microscope camera](https://omaxmicroscope.com/microscope-accessories/cameras/a35180u3-omax-18-0mp-usb3-0-digital-camera-for-microscope-with-0-01mm-calibration-slide-windows-mac-linux.html)  
- [OMAX camera software](https://omaxmicroscope.com/software_download/)
- Samples preserved in either Z-Fix or 4% paraformaldehyde


# Procedure  
1.  Remove an aliquot of preserved sample from tube after gentle mixing by pipette. *CRITICAL: Only use equipment that is meant for use with fixatives. If new equipment is used, dispose of properly as hazardous waste or label as "fixative only" for future use.*  
2. Place an aliquot under the microscope in the microscope dish such that 20-30 individuals are in view. If the photograph frame is too small for visualization of 20-30 samples, reduce aliquot size and take multiple photographs per tube. Multiple photos can be taken per sample.  
3. Ensure that the scale bar is included in the photograph. 
4. Record photograph number on datasheet along with tube number and replicate number (if multiple samples are taken). Rename photographs with sample name and replicate number. For example (Sample#-Photo1, Sample#-Photo2, etc.).  
5. Upload photographs to Google Drive  
6. Repeat for each sample   
7. Samples can then be analyzed for size or volume in ImageJ/Fiji software.
