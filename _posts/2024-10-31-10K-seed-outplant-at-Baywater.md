This post details outplanting 10K Seed at Baywater shellfish.    

## Outplanting at Baywater

Tonight we outplanted oysters at Baywater Shellfish in Thorndyke Bay in the Hood Canal. We met at about 9:00pm, loaded the oysters into floating bags, and attached them to lines on the flats at low tide around 10:45pm.  

Each bag has a purple cattle tag corresponding to the table below.

We dumped the oysters out of mesh seed bags that [we prepared yesterday](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/10K-seed-outplant-preparations/) and secured the bags. Three random bags have the temperature loggers that were launched yesterday as well. 

The bags were attached to three lines with 10 bags per line, all randomly distributed. We will keep in touch with Baywater to help with maintenance and will assess them in the spring!
