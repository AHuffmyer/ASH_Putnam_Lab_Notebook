Tonight Steven, Jeff, and I went to Point Whitney and Baywater to prepare oysters and outplant at Baywater.  

# Overview 

Tonight our goal was to maintain outplant bags at Baywater and to outplant the final PolyIC seed we are holding at Point Whitney out at Baywater.  

## Point Whitney 

Jeff and I went to Point Whitney before outplanting and did the following with the PolyIC seed from the heath trays: 

- Took out each tray and rinsed the oysters
- Took an image of all oysters for size with the purple original tag and a new yellow outplant tag 
- Put all seed in a seed bag for transport to Baywater 

All size images [are available on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/polyIC-larvae/tree/main/data/outplant/baywater/size).

The trays were emptied and are free for other use. There were 8 total trays and therefore 8 total bags of seed to go out.   

## Baywater 

We then went to Baywater and Steven, Jeff, and I put the seed in new outplant bags (1 bag per tray). We attached the yellow outplant tags to the outside of the bag on the float side.  

We then walked the bags out to Line 11 Block E of the farm (right side of the beach in the last set of lines) and attached the 8 new bags to the line with our other outplant bags. 

Finally, we removed the smaller seed from the mesh bags in 3 bags that were outplanted back in August.  

We will return in the spring to assess.
