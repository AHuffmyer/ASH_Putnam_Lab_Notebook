Today we hosted an outreach event with Maritime High School! We hosted ~35 students for several activities. Here is a quick overview of the activities that we did in the lab. We split the students into two groups since it was a large group.   

Zach, Laura, Kathleen, Megan, and I hosted the event! 

## 1. Lab tour, microcope time, and pipetting practice! 

Students got a quick tour of FTR 209 and 213. In 213, we split into two groups. One group dissected oysters and viewed tissue under the compound microscope. The other group practiced pipetting! Megan lead them through an activity to practice their accuracy by measuring the mass of DI water and seawater. For example, students pipetted 1000 uL of DI water and tried to get as close to 1000 mg as possible! 

## 2. Oyster dissections and anatomy 

Students dissected oysters and practiced identifying oyster anatomy. Throughout the activities, students talked with grad students and researchers about their work and journies in science!  

## 3. Fish collections tour in FTR

Katherine gave two short fish collection tours in FTR. Thanks Katherine! 

## 4. SAFS aquarium tour 

Zach and Andy showed the students the aquarium room and answered questions - thank you Zach and Andy! 

It was a fun day!
