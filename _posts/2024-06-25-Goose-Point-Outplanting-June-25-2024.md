This post details activities at Goose Point from 25 June 2024 to outplant oysters.  

# Overview 

Today I went took oysters prepared yesterday to Goose Point for outplanting.  

## Outplanting  

Today I met folks at Goose Point in Willapa Bay at the dock in South Bend, WA to outplant oysters from Effort E prepped from yesterday. Oysters were transported in a cooler with seawater soaked towels and ice. Oysters were kept cool and I did not see any dead oysters during outplanting. 

I transferred oysters from each seed back into a 12mm Seapa basket. We put the oysters in red mesh seed bags within these baskets because the sizes were a bit small and we didn't want them to get stuck to the bags or fall through.  

Juan will check the bags in a few weeks to see their growth and take out of the red mesh bags if they are large enough. During these checks, Juan will not do any counting or remove dead shells. When we want to assess them, we can text Juan and coordinate a date when he can bring in the baskets for us to count and take photos for size.  

The baskets were outplanted to the tidal flats for Goose Point.  

I added four temperature loggers to four random baskets secured with zip ties. All baskets have cattle tags zip tied to the top inside lid.  

We outplanted 100 oysters per basket in 14 total baskets.
