Today I cleaned the tanks in FTR and Jon moved in new tanks to the tank room.  

## Tank cleaning

- Full water change and added new water with salinity at approx. 25 psu
- Added new round of food (lower feeding than in past weeks) 
- Rinsed all oysters and crates/containers 
- Rinsed all pumps and bubblers
- Washed floor 

## New tanks

Jon moved in three new small tanks for projects in the FTR room.

Here are the things I need to do for the new tanks: 

- Add water and allow to soak for 2-3 days 
- Make new standpipes with PVC and add teflon tape or silicon sealant (not adhesive) to ensure they do not leak 
- Do a fill test to make sure the tanks hold water 
- Add a small pump and small heater to each and start Apex systems if we want to do temperature controlled experiments
