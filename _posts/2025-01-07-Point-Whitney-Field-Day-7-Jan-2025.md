This post details activities from the field at Point Whitney for our oyster work. 

## To-do list for today 

- Environmental measurements with multi probe 
- Put 10K seed in new, clean seed bags and image for size/counts 
- Image PolyIC seed for size 
- Package and transport PolyIC seed and broodstock to UW tomorrow 

## Environmental probe measurements 

Poly IC seed readings are [on GitHub here]() and listed below:  


10K seed and all other tank readings are [on GitHub here]() and listed below: 



## 10K seed bags 

I put all 10K seed into new bags, because the current bags had holes or were very overgrown and dirty. 

For each bag, I took out all seed and took an image with a scale bar for counts and size, the old/current tag, and a new cattle tag that I attached. 

I have updated the [metadata on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/10K-seed-Cgigas/blob/main/data/metadata.csv). 

Here is an example of those pictures.

## PolyIC seed 

I took images of a subset of seed that will be transported to UW for growth measurements. The images are available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/RobertsLab/polyIC-larvae/tree/main/data/growth).

I sampled ~500-1000 (that's a guess, unsure how many there really are) seed from each tank into their own mesh packets for transport to UW. These are labeled with the original tank number and treatment condition. 

We have 1000's of seed remaining at the hatchery.  

I also packed up some mesh silos from the hatchery to bring to UW to potentially house the seed. 

The seed will acclimated at UW until next week when I can start running trials. 

## Broodstock 

I selected two families of our USDA broodstock to transport to UW for conditioning experiments. Bags 26 and 34 were taken out of tanks and put in a cooler with ice for transport. 

## To-do next time 

- Image PolyIC seed for size 
- Move seed out of heath trays or thin 
- Download temperature loggers
