# Metabolomics Extraction Protocol 

See my protocol I am using [in my notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral-Metabolomics-Extraction-Protocol-for-2023-Moorea-Project/). 

This post details metabolomics extractions for samples taken during the [2023 Symbiotic Exchange](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023) project.
