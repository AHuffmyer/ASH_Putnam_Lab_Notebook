This post details metaboloimcs extractions for the 2023 Moorea Symbiotic Exchange project.   

# Metabolomics Extraction Protocol 

See the protocol I am using [in my notebook here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral-Metabolomics-Extraction-Protocol-for-2023-Moorea-Project/). 

This post details metabolomics extractions for samples taken during the [2023 Symbiotic Exchange](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023) project. 

#### 20250814 

- Prepared bench and hood areas and cleaned all supplies
- Organized/obtained required chemicals 
- Labeled tubes 
- Located samples 

#### 20250819

- Clipped recruit samples and placed into tubes with 1000 µL of LC water  
- Move larvae into new labeled tubes (added 200 µL LC water to tubes and then moved to new labeled tube) 
- Picked up extraction supplies 
- Noticed few larvae in larval tubes, biomass may be low 

#### 20250819

- Host-symbiont fraction separations (noticed pellets in larval samples and recruit samples with recruit pellets much larger)
- Completed separations for all samples 
- Prepare extraction reagents - 15% ammonium bicarbonate and extraction buffer 

#### 20250902

- Extractions in batches of 10: Samples 1-10 (batch 1), 11-20 (batch 2), and 21-30 (batch 3)  

#### 20250903

- Extractions for samples 31-40 (batch 4) 

#### 20250904

- Final extractions for samples 41-50 (batch 5) and 51-60 (batch 6)
- Boxes prepared for shipment
- Lab areas cleaned 
- *Note*: Sample 47 spilled and is not included in the samples to send (59 total samples)

#### 20250908

- Samples packaged and shipped with dry ice
