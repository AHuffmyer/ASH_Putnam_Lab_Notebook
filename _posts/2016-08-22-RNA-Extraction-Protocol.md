RNA Extraction Protocol used for Geoduck Experiments

RNAzol Extraction Reagent (RNAzol RT, Molecular Research Center, Catalog # RN 190)
[RNAzol Manufacturer's Instructions]({{ https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook}}/protocols/RNAzolRTOct2015.pdf)
"RNAzol RT is used to isolate RNA from tissues, cells, liquid samples or blood. One milliliter is sufficient to process up to 100 mg tissue yielding 50 – 700 μg of large RNA (>200 bases) and 8 – 120μg of small RNA (200 – 10 bases)."

Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep (Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep, Zymo Research, Catalog # R2050)
[Direct-zol Manufacturer's Instructions]({{ https://hputnam.github.io}}/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/protocols/directzol_zymo_r2050i.pdf)
"Quick, spin column purification of high-quality (DNA-free) total RNA directly from TRIzol®, TRI Reagent® and other acid-guanidinium-phenol based reagents (RNAzol®, QIAzol®, TriPureTM, TriSureTM, etc.)."



# Protocol for Isolation of Total RNA 
## RNAzol Steps
* Add 1ml of RNAzol RT to no more than 100mg of tissue in sterile RNAse DNAse free microfuge tube 
* Homogenize tissue and RNAzol mix with teflon microfuge pestle
* Add 0.4ml of Nuclease Free water per 1ml of RNAzol 
* Shake vigorously for 15sec and let sit at room temperature for 5-15min (e.g., for 100mg/ml use 15min)
* Centrifuge samples at 12,000g for 15min
* Remove supernatant into a new RNAse DNAse free microfuge tube 

## Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Steps
* Add an equal volume of 96-100% ethanol to the supernatant from the step above and mix thoroughly
* Transfer mixture to Zymo-Spin IIC Column in collection tube 0.7ml at a time
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec
* Discard flow through and repeat additions and centrifugation as necessary for full mixture
* Add 0.4ml _RNA Wash Buffer_ to the column
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec and discard flow through
### On Column DNAse Treatment
### * Mix 75µl of DNA Digestion Buffer with 5µl of DNase I (6U/µl)
### * Incubate at room temperature for 15min
* Add 0.4ml _RNA PREWash_ to the column 
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec and discard flow through
* Add 0.4ml _RNA PREWash_ to the column 
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec and discard flow through
* Add 0.7ml _RNA Wash Buffer_ to the column 
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 2min and discard flow through
* Transfer the column to a new RNAse DNAse free microfuge tube
* Elute RNA by adding 50µl of DNAse/RNase-Free water directly to the column
* Centrifuge at 12,000g for 30sec
* Aliquot RNA into 4 tubes (3µl for Bioanalyzer, 3µl for Qubit, 2x ~20µl for downstream applications
