RNA Extraction Protocol used for Geoduck Experiments

RNAzol Extraction Reagent (RNAzol® RT, Molecular Research Center Catalog # RN 190)
"RNAzol® RT is used to isolate RNA from tissues, cells, liquid samples or blood. One milliliter is sufficient to process up to 100 mg tissue yielding 50 – 700 μg of large RNA (>200 bases) and 8 – 120μg of small RNA (200 – 10 bases)."
