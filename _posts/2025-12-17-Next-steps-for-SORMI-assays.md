We had a SORMI team meeting today and below are my notes on the next assays we should work on in the lab.  

## Resazurin

### Task 

- Conduct resazurin assays on gill tissue samples of adult oysters exposed to a range of temperature conditions

### Experiment structure 

1. Collect gill tissue samples from oysters and run replicate tissue samples of the same oyster at multiple temperatures (i.e., control, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C) to determine effects of temperature on gill metabolism 

## Glycogen

### Task 

- Conduct glycogen measurements in the lab between different tissue types and relate to stress response 

### Experiment structure

1. Collect tissue sample from gill and mantle tissue in the same oyster and analyze for glycogen content. Determien if content differs between tissue types and if values are correlated between tissues. Determine which tissue type exhibits the least variance in glycogen. 

2. Measure glycogen content in oysters from different families or different stress histories to see if glycogen produces environmental or genetic signals (*in progress with Westcott data for hardening history*)  

## Guava Muse mitochondrial assays 

### Task 

- Conduct mitochondrial potential and activity assays using kits we have in the lab 

### To do 

- I first need to contact the company to ask about use in marine animals and if adjustements need to be made for salinity. 

### Experiment structure

1. Sample gill tissue (with homogenization) and hemolymph tissue from oysters exposed to control conditions and stress conditions (i.e., 33°C for 4 h) and run using assay kits 

This will allow us to: 

- Determine whether signals differ with exposure to stress 

- Determine if we can reliably measure signals using lab kits 

- Determine if signals are similar between tissue types
