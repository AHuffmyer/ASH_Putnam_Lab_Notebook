This post details activities at Point Whitney from 4 June 2024 and preparation of oysters for outplanting at Westcott on 7 June 2024.



  

# Overview 

Today we went to Point Whitney to prepare outplants for Westcott and conduct another round of weekly stressors.

### Weekly probe measurements

AH took weekly measurements at XXX. The only tank with oysters running is the left tank. Fluorometry measurements were 8 in this tank and 5 in the larval silos. We did not do any pulse feeding, Ariana topped off the food reservoir with full concentration food (2 buckets full).

### Field outplant preparation - Westcott  

AH made an overview document for outplanting [that can be found here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/planning/summer-2024-outplanting.md).

## To do next week 

- Download remaining Apex data 
- Add air lines to HUDLs and reconfigure air system 
- Weekly probe measurements 
- Start broodstock stress 
- Reconfigure feeding to deliver more food to system 
- Plan out sampling for LCO and Effort left over oysters
