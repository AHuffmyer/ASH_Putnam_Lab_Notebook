This post details activities at Point Whitney from 12 June 2024.

# Overview 

Today we went to Point Whitney to organize and retag all oysters, set up HUDL larval systems, and reset temperature loggers. 

I've included notes from June 12 and June 13 trips in this post.  

## Tagging, organizing oysters 

Today we organized, moved, and added cattle ear tags to our oysters. A full inventory of tags and current locations can be found [on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/inventory/tags_PointWhitney_20240613.xlsx).  

We moved oysters to the following locations:  

- LCO project: Oysters were moved, but kept on their same rack system into an outdoor upweller. Spat were moved from the silos and into bags. See the list of tags below for more information. Located in the upweller tanks outside of the silos. 
- Effort B: Oysters were kept in an upweller tank with cattle tags added. Located in one silo in an upweller tank. 
- Effort C: Oysters were all moved into one upweller together with cattle tags added. Bags were split between two silos in one upweller. 
- Effort D: Oysters were moved from Heath trays into seed bags in an upweller tank with cattle tags added. Located in one silo in an upweller tank. All oysters from one tray kept in one bag. We have bags for two control trays and two stress trays. See list below for more information.  
- Effort E: Oysters were moved from Heath trays into seed bags in an upweller tank with cattle tags added. Located in one silo in an upweller tank. All oysters from each treatment group were added to one seed bag. We have bags for fresh water treated, fresh water control, temperature treated, and temperature control. See list below for more information. These will be outplanted to Goose Point in a couple weeks. 
- Effort F: Broodstock receievd from USDA ARS kept in adult bags labeled with family with cattle tags added. Adult bags put in the bottom of an upweller tank not in a silo.  
- New seed (USDA ARS 24) were put in the newly opened heath trays. We had one tray per family, labeled by family ID and with a cattle tag included.  
- We tried to tag extras of the Pacific Hybreed families, but some are unknown and we will need to do some DNA work to ID ploidy on these families.  

Here are images of all the oysters in upwellers.

## HUDL systems and tank set up 

Steven set up air lines, cleaned the HUDLS, and added heaters to try to get the temperature in the HUDLs up to 25°C. Heaters control temperature in the water bath. I also increased the header tank temperature to 70°F (~21°C) to try to increase the temperature - done at 10:45 am.

## Weekly probe and fluorescence measurements 

I conducted weekly probe measurements on all tanks and [added to GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements.csv).  

| tank         | date    | time  | temp.C | pH.nbs | sal.psu | initials | notes            |

I took fluorescence measurements on 13 June.  

- Larval indoor tanks = 8, 11, 11 (this is pretty good! We will want to increase to about 15 if we can) 
- Upwellers = 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2 
- Heath trays = 3, 4, 2

## Weekly Effort E stressors 

On 13 June 2024, I conducted weekly Effort E stressors from 11:00-11:30am. I also entered all stressor data from this week and previous weeks [on GitHub](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements_weekly_stressors.csv) and shown below.

## Downloading temperature loggers 

I downloaded two loggers today. I downloaded SSN 20174086 from heath trays and SSN 20174087 (both pendants) from the left indoor tank. Both of these had a battery error, so data may be incomplete. These were stopped and not relaunced. Data were [added to GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main/data/environmental/loggers).  

## Downloading Apex data 

I downloaded Apex data from January onward using [this script](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/code/download_apex.Rmd). Data were uploaded to [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/tree/main/data/environmental/apex).  

## Launching new loggers 

We launched new Hobo Tidbit loggers along with all of our groups. Here is the logger metadata.
