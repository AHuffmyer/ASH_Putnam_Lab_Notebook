This post details activities at Point Whitney from 19 June 2024.

# Overview 

Today I went to Point Whitney to check larvae, take probe measurements, check gonad development in broodstock, and start a new broodstock stressor.  

## Checking on larvae 

I checked on the larvae today that Steven and Carrie put in the HUDLs [last week](https://sr320.github.io/tumbling-oysters/posts/sr320-24-fd/). I poured the contents of one HUDL onto a 40um screen and rinsed the larvae into a small volume. 

I then viewed the larvae under the scope.

I estimated that we had approximately 60K larvae in one HUDL. 

The HUDLs look good, but have a lot of algae on the filters.

Fluorometry measurments in HUDLs were 29, 12, 90, 74, 32, 16, and 24. Fluorescence was variable and a bit high. We want something closer to 15-20. We will need to lower the pump next time we are out. Outdoor tanks were at 1, 4, and 1.  

I added seawater to the food bucket to dilute it and fill it.  

I added EDTA at 1g/1000L concentration. I mixed 0.2g EDTA with some hot fresh water, mixed, and added to our 55 gallon header (208 L).  

Larvae were returned to the HUDL.  

## Probe measurements 

Weekly tank measurements:

Measurements are on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements.csv).  

Stressor treatments:  

| treatment   | date    | time  | temp.C | pH.nbs | sal.psu | initials |
|-------------|---------|-------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| temperature | 6/19/24 | 11:30 | 25.7   | 8.01   | 30.11   | ash      |
| fresh       | 6/19/24 | 11:30 | 15.9   | 7.96   | 0.249   | ash      |
| control     | 6/19/24 | 11:30 | 12.7   | 7.61   | 29.3    | ash      |

Stressor measurements are on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements_weekly_stressors.csv).  

## Effort E spat weekly stressors 

I conducted one more set of weekly stressors on Effort E spat. These will be outplanted at Goose Point next week. See probe measurements above for treatment conditions. Treatments took place in 5 gallon buckets at the treatment conditions from 11:00-11:30. Control oysters were placed in the indoor tank at ambient conditions (recorded above).  

## Lifestage carryover size measurements 

I measured the length of all LCO oysters today and took photos of spat for image analysis. The images [are on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover/data/size/notebook_images/20240619).  Size is analyzed in ImageJ by using the caliper as a scale bar and measuring ~120 spat in each image. I do this by zooming in on 4 non overlapping areas and measuring all individuals that I have a clear view of maximum length and measure length in mm until reaching 120 individuals.  

I entered data from size measurements from the LCO project today. The size data is [on Github here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/size/gigas-lengths-individuals.csv).  

Spat data from image measurements [are on GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/size/gigas-lengths-lco.csv).  

## Checking broodstock gamete development 

I cracked open two oysters from family 27.052 to check for gamete development. I got lucky and had one male and one female. The gonad tissue wasn't very big, so they may need a couple more weeks of conditioning. I was able to see concentrated egg and sperm! The eggs looked concentrated and mostly tear drop shaped. The sperm was concentrated but I didn't see much motility.

## Broodstock stressors 

We decided to trial a fresh water stress on the new broodstock from USDA. I chose two families, assessed any mortality, rinsed them, and separated them into two bags - one treated and one control per family. Here is the information:  

Family 27.052  

- n=10 into treated bag 
- n=15 into control bag  
- We had no mortality in this family 
- Sampled two for checking gametes 
- Treated bag = cattle tag 099
- Control bag = cattle tag 029 

Family 27.009 

- n=9 into treated bag 
- n=9 into control bag 
- 2 in this family were dead and shells were removed 
- Treated bag = cattle tag 100
- Control bag = 035 

I recorded sizes of all individuals. I placed the control oysters in an indoor tank at ambient conditions and put the treated oysters in fresh water for 30 minutes from 11:45-12:15. See probe measurements for conditions. Returned to upwellers.

Initial sizes (length x width x depth) are recorded on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/sizes/F_Broodstock_USDA/F_sizes.csv).  

An updated tag inventory is on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/inventory/tags_PointWhitney_20240619.xlsx).  

## Prepping for Goose Point outplants next week 

I launched some loggers in preparation for outplanting, set to start logging on Monday at 09:00.
