This post details continued analysis of metabolomics data for the 2020 *M. capitata* developmental time series with WGCNA.  

# **WGCNA metabolomics analysis**  

Kevin Wong further revised the WGCNA metabolomics pipeline with his scripts [found here](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Porites_Rim_Bleaching_2019/blob/master/scripts/Metabolomics/Metabolomics_WGCNA.Rmd).  

I conducted previous WGCNA analysis on metabolomics data detailed in the [Part 1 post](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Metabolomics-WGCNA-Analysis-Part-1/).   

Today, I revised this script to build off of Kevin Wong's approach. This simplifies the script and uses `blockwiseModules` rather than `dynamicTreeCut` to generate modules.
