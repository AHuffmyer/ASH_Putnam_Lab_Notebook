This post details WGCNA preliminary analysis for the E5 Deep Dive Project. 

More information on this project can be found on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive). 

This analysis uses the gene count matrix produced using [this workflow](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/E5-Deep-Dive-RNAseq-Count-Matrix-Analysis/). 

# 1. Data filtering and transformation 

# 2. Network construction 

# 3. Visualizing results 

# 4. Next steps

- Conduct DESeq2 analysis as done by Danielle Becker to confirm that we obtaining the same results as she did in previous analyses.  
- Run WGCNA with all available physiological metrics. 
- Run WGCNA of lnRNA with Zack and conduct module correlation between RNA and lcRNA modules
