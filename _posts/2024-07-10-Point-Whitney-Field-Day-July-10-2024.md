This post details activities at Point Whitney from 10 July 2024.

# Overview 

Today I ran the continuing 10K seed stressors and weekly broodstock stressor at Point Whitney.  

## Cleaning tanks

I didn't see any larvae in our HUDLs, so I drained and cleaned them and left the tank empty. I kept the water lines running to allow the algae tank to drain. I turned off all heaters and rinsed all tanks.   

## Probe measurements 

Measurements are on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements.csv).  

Stressor measurements are on [GitHub here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/environmental/probe_measurements_weekly_stressors.csv).  

## Broodstock weekly stressors 

Broodstock from bags 99 and 100 were added to a bucket with fresh water from 10:20-10:50.  

## Stressors for new/10K seed 

Today we did stressors for Kathleen's experiment by increasing temperature in the right tank to 35°C with a few inches of water. We had some electrical overload problems, so we ultimately did this using 1 800W heater and 2 300-500W heaters. All heaters were add to the 35°C tank to get it up to temperature. Then, one heater was put back in the larval tank set to 28°C and one went into a bucket of fresh water to heat to 35°C.  

I did the following stressors: 

1. New PW seed: Freshwater for 1 hour in a bucket. Done from 10:30-11:30.  
2. New PW seed: 35°C seawater for 1 hour in the right tank. Done from 11:00-12:00. 
3. New PW seed: 35°C freshwater for 1 hour in a heated bucket. Done from 10:30-11:30.  

We will continue the MWF stressors through this week and I will take all effort B/E/D oysters to UW along with a subsample of the 10K seed next week for testing and sampling.

## LCO check in 

I didn't see any mortality in LCO oysters. The bags were really dirty in the tank, so I moved them into a 3-holer well in the same tank.
