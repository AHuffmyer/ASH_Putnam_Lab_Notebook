This post details weekly oyster maintenance protocols for the tanks in FTR.  

## Water change and adjust salinity 

Each week, perform a water change by removing ~ 5 gallons (large bucket) of water from each tank. 

- Remove the oyster baskets from each tank and set them on the floor. They can stay out of the water as long as needed during the water change. 
- Test the salinity of the main tanks. Our goal is to have them between 20-25 ppt. If they are low, we will increase the salinity by adding higher salinity water during the water change. If salinity is high, add lower salinity water during the water change. 
- Replace the removed water with new water by filling a large bucket from the hose. Then, adjust the salinity by adding salt (Instant Ocean) to the bucket and stirring until dissolved. The water should be between 20-25 ppt. Use the refractometer to check the salinity. 
- *Note: if the water in the main tank was either too high or too low in salinity, adjust the salinity during the water change. For example, if salinity in the tank is low, make the bucket 30-35 ppt. If salinity was too high, just add fresh water (no salt).* 
- Add the new water into the tank. Repeat for each tank. 
- Test the salinity after adding the new water. Adjust again if needed to have the main tanks at 20-25 ppt. 
- Return oysters to the tanks.

## Removing dead shells 

During the water change process, visually check for any floating or empty shells and discard of them. 

## Feeding oysters 

- From the feeding stock in the fridge in FTR 213, add approx. 1 Tablespoon to each tank and stir to distribute the food evenly.  
- This should be done once per week.
