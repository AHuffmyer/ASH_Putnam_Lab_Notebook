This post details daily entries for the Fall 2023 Moorea Field Expedition. 

The goal of this expedition is to conduct research within Ariana Huffmyer's National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship research. 

Experimental design and overview of this project including questions of interest and object can be viewed below.

# Thursday - November 11, 2023 

Today we worked on finding our equipment, setting up our supplies, and making experimental plans. We started setting up our equipment for PI curves/respirometry, coral collection, and spawning. 

We will be using the [SMILE systems described in my past posts here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Hawaii-2023-Coral-Spawning-and-Field-Expedition-Daily-Entry/) for *Acropora spp.* spawning. 

We talked with folks from CRIOBE and they observed high *Acropora pulchra* spawning last month. Hollie and Pierrick cracked a couple fragments of colonies at Mahana and didn't see any eggs. We decided to not focus on *A. pulchra* and instead bring in some *A. hyacinthus*, which spawn in +8 to +10 days after the full moon. We will bring in colonies tomorrow/Saturday.  

Hollie and Ariana went to Tahiti to help Nyssa Silbiger's group with sampling on Friday.
