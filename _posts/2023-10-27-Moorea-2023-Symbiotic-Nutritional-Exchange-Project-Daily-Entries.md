# Thursday - November 2, 2023 

Today we worked on finding our equipment, setting up our supplies, and making experimental plans. We started setting up our equipment for PI curves/respirometry, coral collection, and spawning. 

We will be using the [SMILE systems described in my past posts here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Hawaii-2023-Coral-Spawning-and-Field-Expedition-Daily-Entry/) for *Acropora spp.* spawning. 

We talked with folks from CRIOBE and they observed high *Acropora pulchra* spawning last month. Hollie and Pierrick cracked a couple fragments of colonies at Mahana and didn't see any eggs. We decided to not focus on *A. pulchra* and instead bring in some *A. hyacinthus*, which spawn in +8 to +10 days after the full moon. We will bring in colonies tomorrow/Saturday.  

Hollie and Ariana went to Tahiti to help Nyssa Silbiger's group with sampling on Friday.  

# Friday - November 3, 2023 

Ariana and Hollie helped Nyssa's group sample corals and water on Tahiti at three sites. 

When we got back to Moorea Ariana labeled whirl packs for collecting adult and recruit samples for PI curves tomorrow. Ariana labeled whirl packs for the following corals: 

*Acropora*: 
Adults = ACR A1-A5
Recruits = ACR R1-R10

*Pocillopora*: 
Adults = POC A1-A5
Recruits = POC R1-R10

*Porites*: 
Adults = POR A1-A5
Recruits = POR R1-R10 

We prepared a hammer and chisel, knife, collection bags, and ruler with color standard for collections tomorrow. 
 
Pierrick and Chloe collected 7 *Acropora hyacinthus* colonies (20-30 cm diameter) from Manava and placed them in large blue bin tanks at Gump in preparation for spawning. Pierrick also collected a set of test recruits of *Pocillopora* (n=8) to have as practice for PI curves and respiration measurements. 

Pierrick and Chloe added tubing and other spawning equipment into a bleach bath to clean before spawning. 

# Saturday - November 4, 2023

## Preparing spawning and setting up tanks 

This morning, Pierrick and Chloe collected 6 more *Acropora hyacinthus* colonies (20-30 cm diameter) from Manava and added them to the blue bins (07:00-08:00). 4 corals were in each blue bin with high water flow. The electricity is not working at the tanks, so the corals didn't have a pump last night.

Pierrick and Ariana then collect adults and recruits (see below) at Ava'iti (11:00-12:00) and collected 3 more *A. hyacinthus* from this site. We now have 16 total colonies. 

Because the pumps were not working, Hollie and Chloe purchased a large pump at Polymat. We then moved all corals to a new large blue bin. The corals had very high water flow and water circulation after being added to the new tank at 15:00. All corals looked healthy. 

While Ariana and Pierrick were collecting colonies, we saw eggs in a broken fragment. Eggs were mature - so we expect spawning to happen this month in at least some of the colonies.

We set up an adapted version of our spawning larval rearing systems at 15:00. Rather than using the coolers as a water delivery system in the SMILE systems, we put 12 squaricals on a water table and assembled a tubing manifold with 12 outlets that was tied above the table. This will allow us to supply 50 um filtered seawater from our canister filters on this line directly to the 12 squaricals. Squaricals will drain through banjo filters into the water table. We bleached and cleaned all equipment and added new hot glue seals to the banjo filter outlets. 

This is adapted from last year's spawning projects in Moorea detailed [in my Moorea 2022 expedition notebook post here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Moorea-2022-Coral-Spawning-and-Field-Expedition-Daily-Entry/). 

Here is a look at our initial set up.

## Collecting adults and recruits for PI curves 

Pierrick and Ariana collected adult and recruit samples for the Symbiotic Exchange project. We decided to sample *Acropora, Pocillopora, and Porites* corals from the Ava'iti site. The original experimental design only included *Acropora* and *Pocillopora*. We have the capacity to add in *Porites* and it is a relevant species for this study. We will adjust the experimental design as we go through the study to account for another species within the same number of total samples. 

Today we collected 5 adult and 10 recruit samples from each species. We collected fragments from adult colonies. We are aiming for a genera level comparison because we will only be able to identify species in small recruits after DNA analysis. Therefore, we will collect adult samples representative of the species at our site so that the species composition of the adults and recruits are (hopefully) equally mixed. We will collect recruits across a range of sizes from ~ 1-4 cm in diameter. From intial scouting, it will be easier to find very small recruits of *Pocillopora*, but it will be harder to find very small recruits of the other species. 

#### Collection protocol 

Our goals for collection for each species were as follows. 

*Acropora*: Sample recruits <5 cm, across a range of sizes from as small as possible to no more than 5 cm diameter. Sample recruits that are clearly separated from adult colonies to avoid any collection of small corals resulting from fragmentation. May include multiple *Acropora* species due to difficulty distinguishing species from smallest recruits. We will collect adult fragments using a chisel and recruits using a hammer and chisel. 

*Pocillopora*: Sample recruits <5 cm, across a range of sizes from as small as possible to no more than 5 cm diameter. We should be able to find very small recruits pretty easily.  May include multiple *Pocillopora* species due to difficulty distinguishing species from smallest recruits. We will collect adult fragments using a chisel and recruits using a dive knife or chisel.

*Porites*: Sample recruits <5 cm, across a range of sizes from as small as possible to no more than 5 cm diameter. Massive *Porites* small corals can often result from fragmentation or mortality of a larger colony leaving small sections behind. To avoid this, we will sample recruits that are far from other adult tissue. May include multiple massive *Porites* species due to difficulty distinguishing species from smallest recruits. We will collect adult and recruit fragments using a hammer and chisel. 

Today we collected the following sample numbers: 

*Acropora*: 
Adults = ACR A1-A5
Recruits = ACR R1-R10

*Pocillopora*: 
Adults = POC A1-A5
Recruits = POC R1-R10

*Porites*: 
Adults = POR A1-A5
Recruits = POR R1-R10 

Here is the protocol we followed for collection today:

*Materials*: 

- 2 mesh bags with clips
- Hammer and chisel
- Dive knife
- Labeled whirl packs
- Ruler with color scale 
- Camera

*Procedure*: 

- One person will collect the corals ("collector") and the other will take pictures and hold the bags of collected corals ("holder"). 
- Swim on the reef until finding a coral to sample using the criteria described above. 
- Take out a bag corresponding to the correct life stage. Bags are labeled "species-lifestage-number". For example, ACR-R-1 is Acropora-recruit-1. See list above for numbers sampled today. 
- The collector will hold the ruler with color scale and the labeled whirlpack next to the coral. The holder will take a picture with the label and ruler included. 
- The collector will then take the sample using a knife or hammer and chisel as needed. Try to take as little rock or other material as possible, but try not to break the recruit. 
- The holder then puts the sample in the whirlpack, fills the whirlpack with water, secures the whirlpack, and puts it in the mesh bag. 
- Repeat until all corals are sampled. Today we collected all POC, then collected ACR and POR as we came across them. 
- Put the corals in a cooler of water to keep them submerged. Back at the lab, put the corals in a tank or water table. Put on plugs ASAP (see below).  
- Upload photos to Google Drive (link below).

Overall, following this protocol worked very well. We were successful in collecting all samples (45 total) within about 1.5 hours. We were able to sample across a size gradient for all species. With two people the process was pretty smooth. The corals were brought back in filled whirl packs and placed in the water tables at 12:00. Bags were opened to allow for water flow while submerged until we were ready to add them onto plugs at 13:30. 

This site will be good to return to for the rest of the study.   

Photographs of the corals in field collections and a photograph of all plug corals are in [today's Google Drive folder here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1uJvVrTLfEo5AT9XIapD0OPebUCW5AzWt). 

## Adding adult and recruit samples to plugs for PI curves 

After collection, we added the adult and recruit samples to plugs using the following steps. 

- Prepare plugs by drying them and writing the sample ID/number on the plug stem with permanent marker. 
- Add a drop of coral glue onto the plug. 
- Trim off any excess material, organisms, or rock from the coral sample.
- Take the coral out of the water and dry the base with a paper towel. 
- Place the coral onto the plug out of the water on a rack. Use more glue if needed. 
- Leave to set for ~1-2 minutes. 
- Return the plug with coral sample to the water table on a rack. 
- Repeat in batches of 3-4 corals at a time. 
- Maintain high water flow and circulation. 
- Take an image of corals on plugs with a ruler and color scale as seen below. 

We noticed that we accidentally collected 11 recruits of ACR and 4 adults. ACR-A-2 was incorrectly used to collect a recruit. We used that recruit as a test sample and took an adult fragment from one of the corals we brought to the lab from our same site. This adult is labeled ACR-A-2 and a new image was taken in the lab tank. 

Here are some example images. 

![](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2023/pic7.jpeg?raw=true)  

In this image, the first row (bottom) is a test set of POC with 1 ACR and 1 POR. The second row (second from bottom) is ACR samples, with the first 5 being adults and the last 10 being recruits. The third row (third from bottom) is POC and the fourth row (top row) is POC. These are all in the order of A-1 through A-5 followed by R1-R10 for each species.
