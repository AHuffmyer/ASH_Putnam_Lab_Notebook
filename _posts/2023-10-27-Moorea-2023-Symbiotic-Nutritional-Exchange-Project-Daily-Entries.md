# Thursday - November 2, 2023 

Today we worked on finding our equipment, setting up our supplies, and making experimental plans. We started setting up our equipment for PI curves/respirometry, coral collection, and spawning. 

We will be using the [SMILE systems described in my past posts here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Hawaii-2023-Coral-Spawning-and-Field-Expedition-Daily-Entry/) for *Acropora spp.* spawning. 

We talked with folks from CRIOBE and they observed high *Acropora pulchra* spawning last month. Hollie and Pierrick cracked a couple fragments of colonies at Mahana and didn't see any eggs. We decided to not focus on *A. pulchra* and instead bring in some *A. hyacinthus*, which spawn in +8 to +10 days after the full moon. We will bring in colonies tomorrow/Saturday.  

Hollie and Ariana went to Tahiti to help Nyssa Silbiger's group with sampling on Friday.  

# Friday - November 3, 2023 

Ariana and Hollie helped Nyssa's group sample corals and water on Tahiti at three sites. 

When we got back to Moorea Ariana labeled whirl packs for collecting adult and recruit samples for PI curves tomorrow. Ariana labeled whirl packs for the following corals: 

*Acropora*: 
Adults = ACR A1-A5
Recruits = ACR R1-R10

*Pocillopora*: 
Adults = POC A1-A5
Recruits = POC R1-R10

*Porites*: 
Adults = POR A1-A5
Recruits = POR R1-R10 

We prepared a hammer and chisel, knife, collection bags, and ruler with color standard for collections tomorrow. 
 
Pierrick and Chloe collected 7 *Acropora hyacinthus* colonies (20-30 cm diameter) from Manava and placed them in large blue bin tanks at Gump in preparation for spawning. Pierrick also collected a set of test recruits of *Pocillopora* (n=8) to have as practice for PI curves and respiration measurements. 

Pierrick and Chloe added tubing and other spawning equipment into a bleach bath to clean before spawning. 

# Saturday - November 4, 2023

## Preparing spawning and setting up tanks 

This morning, Pierrick and Chloe collected 6 more *Acropora hyacinthus* colonies (20-30 cm diameter) from Manava and added them to the blue bins (07:00-08:00). 4 corals were in each blue bin with high water flow. The electricity is not working at the tanks, so the corals didn't have a pump last night.

Pierrick and Ariana then collect adults and recruits (see below) at Ava'iti (11:00-12:00) and collected 3 more *A. hyacinthus* from this site. We now have 16 total colonies. 

Because the pumps were not working, Hollie and Chloe purchased a large pump at Polymat. We then moved all corals to a new large blue bin. The corals had very high water flow and water circulation after being added to the new tank at 15:00. All corals looked healthy. 

While Ariana and Pierrick were collecting colonies, we saw eggs in a broken fragment. Eggs were mature - so we expect spawning to happen this month in at least some of the colonies. 

![](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2023/pic3.png?raw=true)  

We set up an adapted version of our spawning larval rearing systems at 15:00. Rather than using the coolers as a water delivery system in the SMILE systems, we put 12 squaricals on a water table and assembled a tubing manifold with 12 outlets that was tied above the table. This will allow us to supply 50 um filtered seawater from our canister filters on this line directly to the 12 squaricals. Squaricals will drain through banjo filters into the water table. We bleached and cleaned all equipment and added new hot glue seals to the banjo filter outlets. 

This is adapted from last year's spawning projects in Moorea detailed [in my Moorea 2022 expedition notebook post here](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Moorea-2022-Coral-Spawning-and-Field-Expedition-Daily-Entry/). 

Here is a look at our initial set up. 

![](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2023/pic1.png?raw=true)  

We did not observe setting or spawning tonight. 

## Collecting adults and recruits for PI curves 

Pierrick and Ariana collected adult and recruit samples for the Symbiotic Exchange project. We decided to sample *Acropora, Pocillopora, and Porites* corals from the Ava'iti site. The original experimental design only included *Acropora* and *Pocillopora*. We have the capacity to add in *Porites* and it is a relevant species for this study. We will adjust the experimental design as we go through the study to account for another species within the same number of total samples. 

Today we collected 5 adult and 10 recruit samples from each species. We collected fragments from adult colonies. We are aiming for a genera level comparison because we will only be able to identify species in small recruits after DNA analysis. Therefore, we will collect adult samples representative of the species at our site so that the species composition of the adults and recruits are (hopefully) equally mixed. We will collect recruits across a range of sizes from ~ 1-4 cm in diameter. From intial scouting, it will be easier to find very small recruits of *Pocillopora*, but it will be harder to find very small recruits of the other species. 

#### Collection protocol 

Our goals for collection for each species were as follows. 

*Acropora*: Sample recruits <5 cm, across a range of sizes from as small as possible to no more than 5 cm diameter. Sample recruits that are clearly separated from adult colonies to avoid any collection of small corals resulting from fragmentation. May include multiple *Acropora* species due to difficulty distinguishing species from smallest recruits. We will collect adult fragments using a chisel and recruits using a hammer and chisel. 

*Pocillopora*: Sample recruits <5 cm, across a range of sizes from as small as possible to no more than 5 cm diameter. We should be able to find very small recruits pretty easily.  May include multiple *Pocillopora* species due to difficulty distinguishing species from smallest recruits. We will collect adult fragments using a chisel and recruits using a dive knife or chisel.

*Porites*: Sample recruits <5 cm, across a range of sizes from as small as possible to no more than 5 cm diameter. Massive *Porites* small corals can often result from fragmentation or mortality of a larger colony leaving small sections behind. To avoid this, we will sample recruits that are far from other adult tissue. May include multiple massive *Porites* species due to difficulty distinguishing species from smallest recruits. We will collect adult and recruit fragments using a hammer and chisel. 

Today we collected the following sample numbers: 

*Acropora*: 
Adults = ACR A1-A5
Recruits = ACR R1-R10

*Pocillopora*: 
Adults = POC A1-A5
Recruits = POC R1-R10

*Porites*: 
Adults = POR A1-A5
Recruits = POR R1-R10 

Here is the protocol we followed for collection today:

*Materials*: 

- 2 mesh bags with clips
- Hammer and chisel
- Dive knife
- Labeled whirl packs
- Ruler with color scale 
- Camera

*Procedure*: 

- One person will collect the corals ("collector") and the other will take pictures and hold the bags of collected corals ("holder"). 
- Swim on the reef until finding a coral to sample using the criteria described above. 
- Take out a bag corresponding to the correct life stage. Bags are labeled "species-lifestage-number". For example, ACR-R-1 is Acropora-recruit-1. See list above for numbers sampled today. 
- The collector will hold the ruler with color scale and the labeled whirlpack next to the coral. The holder will take a picture with the label and ruler included. 
- The collector will then take the sample using a knife or hammer and chisel as needed. Try to take as little rock or other material as possible, but try not to break the recruit. 
- The holder then puts the sample in the whirlpack, fills the whirlpack with water, secures the whirlpack, and puts it in the mesh bag. 
- Repeat until all corals are sampled. Today we collected all POC, then collected ACR and POR as we came across them. 
- Put the corals in a cooler of water to keep them submerged. Back at the lab, put the corals in a tank or water table. Put on plugs ASAP (see below).  
- Upload photos to Google Drive (link below).

![](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2023/pic6.jpeg?raw=true) 

Overall, following this protocol worked very well. We were successful in collecting all samples (45 total) within about 1.5 hours. We were able to sample across a size gradient for all species. With two people the process was pretty smooth. The corals were brought back in filled whirl packs and placed in the water tables at 12:00. Bags were opened to allow for water flow while submerged until we were ready to add them onto plugs at 13:30. 

This site will be good to return to for the rest of the study.   

Photographs of the corals in field collections and a photograph of all plug corals are in [today's Google Drive folder here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1uJvVrTLfEo5AT9XIapD0OPebUCW5AzWt). 

## Adding adult and recruit samples to plugs for PI curves 

After collection, we added the adult and recruit samples to plugs using the following steps. 

- Prepare plugs by drying them and writing the sample ID/number on the plug stem with permanent marker. 
- Add a drop of coral glue onto the plug. 
- Trim off any excess material, organisms, or rock from the coral sample.
- Take the coral out of the water and dry the base with a paper towel. 
- Place the coral onto the plug out of the water on a rack. Use more glue if needed. 
- Leave to set for ~1-2 minutes. 
- Return the plug with coral sample to the water table on a rack. 
- Repeat in batches of 3-4 corals at a time. 
- Maintain high water flow and circulation. 
- Take an image of corals on plugs with a ruler and color scale as seen below. 

We noticed that we accidentally collected 11 recruits of ACR and 4 adults. ACR-A-2 was incorrectly used to collect a recruit. We used that recruit as a test sample and took an adult fragment from one of the corals we brought to the lab from our same site. This adult is labeled ACR-A-2 and a new image was taken in the lab tank. 

Here are some example images. 

![](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/NotebookImages/Moorea2023/pic7.jpeg?raw=true)  

In this image, the first row (bottom) is a test set of POC with 1 ACR and 1 POR. The second row (second from bottom) is ACR samples, with the first 5 being adults and the last 10 being recruits. The third row (third from bottom) is POC and the fourth row (top row) is POC. These are all in the order of A-1 through A-5 followed by R1-R10 for each species.

These samples will be used for PI curves tomorrow. 

# Sunday - November 5, 2023 

Today we prepared equipment and tests for PI curves, prepared sampling probes, and monitored for spawning. 

## Checking on adults and recruits 

The adults and recruits on plugs looked good today at 08:00. No tissue mortality. Possibly some slight bleaching on adult POC tissues that we will keep an eye on.  

## Running PI curves

Here are the things we did today to prepare for running PI curves tomorrow:  

- Read through protocol
- Prepped chambers, trimmed stands, trimmed and re glued corals that were too tall (POC and ACR adults). Trimmed fragments with coral saw at 16:00. 
- Cleaned lab and set up area 
- Set up OXY 10 units and equipment using the Putnam Lab [OXY protocol](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Respirometry_Protocol/Respirometry_Manual.md). 
- Calibrated 0% sodium sulfite and 100% airsaturated 50 um FSW (continuous bubbling for 30 min). We made the solutions and then calibrated the probes all in 0% and then all in 100% seawater following the protocol above. Probes were allowed to sit in the 0% solution for about 30 minutes prior to calibration. The calibration values for all probes are as follows. Calibration was conducted from 15:30-16:30. Calibration done at 21°C.

- Prepared Apex unit to control water temperature in the OXY chamber bath. Also prepared two water baths below the OXY table to pre heat temperatures for when we do multiple temperature runs for P & R rates. Used 1 Apex unit, 1 EB8 energy bar, 2 PM1s, and 3 temperature probes. Set up on Apex Fusion in the Putnam Lab account. 
- Calibrated pH and conductivity probes. Calibrated pH probe with Tris batch T27. Conductivity probe calibrated with 1413 uS/cm at 20.7°C. Temperature probe is RS-232. Apogee probe is MQ-S10 SSN 3706.

- Collected daily measurements at 15:00 in the water table (with corals on plugs) and in the blue tank (with *A. hyacinthus* adults). Weather was rainy and cloudy, so light is low.

- Optimized lights with 6 16HD light array and took light measurments at each position in the chambers. We tried using 2 32 HD lights but the light was too intense in the center of the array. We are using 18 chambers in this arrangement below. We used 6 AI 16HD lights and light was within 50 PAR between all 18 positions. Hollie will take full light measurements tomorrow for all positions.

- Determined light levels to use for PI curves. We will run 3 PI curves tomorrow. Each run will have 2 blanks, 1 temperature probe within a chamber, and 15 coral samples. We have 15 samples of each species today, so we will do 3 PI curve runs tomorrow. Because we do not have any OXY temperature probes (oops!), we will deploy the temperature logger (Hobo Tidbit) logging every 1 second to match the frequency of data collection in the Oxy 10 system. We can then use this to back calculate oxygen solubility when analyzing the data. The water bath does not stay constant enough to rely only on a static temperature input.

## Preparing for the next sampling 

Today Pierrick fixed the coral saw, which we will use for adding corals to plugs and trimming fragments as needed. 

Tomorrow we will collect the following corals, which will supply about 1.5-2 days of PR runs: 

- ACR-A-6 to ACR-A-17
- ACR-R-11 to ACR-R-30
- POC-A-6 to POC-A-17
- POC-R-11 to POC-R-30
- POR-A-6 to POR-A-17
- POR-R-11 to POR-R-30

96 total corals. I expect this will take about 3-4 hours to collect. The last time we collected it was half this amount collected in about 1.5 hours. 

Ariana rinsed and dried a new set of plugs. Ariana also labled whirlpacks with these coral ID's and labeled DNA tubes (yellow cryo labels with date, "DNA", coral sample ID, and running consecutive number; tubes 1-96). Field equipment, bags, and whirlpacks were prepped. Tubes were labeled and placed in boxes. 

[Sample manifest](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023/blob/main/data/master_sample_manifest.xlsx) and [DNA lists](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/moorea_symbiotic_exchange_2023/blob/main/data/dna/dna_metadata.xlsx) are on GitHub. 

## Adjusting plans  

We will revise the P & R rates protocol to run the following profile: 

- Ik PAR (15 min): P rates 
- 0 PAR (15 min): LEDR rates 
- Ik PAR (5-10 min): light exposure for preparation for molecular sampling 
- Then, sample a clipping for RNA into RNA/DNA shield
- Then, sample remaining fragment into whirl pack and flash freeze. 

## Spawning 

- Check colonies
- Watch for spawning 
- No spawning
